so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless go by converter
good case excellent value
great for the jawbone
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than minutes major problems
the mic is great
have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one
if you are razr owner you must have this
needless to say wasted my money
what waste of money and time
and the sound quality is great
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery
if the two were seperated by mere ft started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset
very good quality though
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all
highly recommend for any one who has blue tooth phone
advise everyone do not be fooled
so far so good
works great
it clicks into place in way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last
went on motorola s website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again
bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it
the commercials are the most misleading
have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that s three days without charging
bought it for my mother and she had problem with the battery
great pocket pc phone combination
ve owned this phone for months now and can say that it s the best mobile phone ve had
did n t think that the instructions provided were helpful to me
people couldnt hear me talk and had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone
does n t hold charge
this is simple little phone to use but the breakage is
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive
it is unusable in moving car at freeway speed
have two more years left in this contract and hate this phone
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice recommended
you need at least mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone battery life is short
it has kept up very well
poor talk time performance
the case is great and works fine with the
worthless product
it has great camera thats and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality
was not impressed by this product
nice headset priced right
only hear garbage for audio
excellent bluetooth headset
it has all the features want
who in their right mind is gon na buy this battery
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days
this case seems well made
disappointed with battery
not loud enough and does n t turn on like it should
good protection and does not make phone too bulky
usable keyboard actually turns pda into real world useful machine instead of just neat gadget
this phone is pretty sturdy and ve never had any large problems with it
love this thing
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i
very disappointed
even dropped this phone into stream and it was submerged for seconds and it still works great
have been very happy with the and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end
the buttons for on and off are bad
essentially you can forget microsoft s tech support
really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool
these headphones were great find and think they are perhaps the best purchase ve made in the last several years seriously
buy different phone but not this
you have to hold the phone at particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
the one big drawback of the player is that the buttons on the phone s front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after few seconds
week later after activated it it suddenly died
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes
great for ipods too
this device is great in several
mic does n t work
even in my bmw series which is fairly quiet have trouble hearing what the other person is saying
great choice
nice docking station for home or work
this is beautiful phone
love this product
do not buy for wrongly advertised for
this is great little item
love this phone it is very handy and has lot of features
purchased this and within days it was no longer working
wear it everyday and it holds up very well
not good bargain
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended
the battery runs down quickly
this item worked great but it broke after months of use
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them
this phone works great
the construction of the headsets is poor
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper
the phone loads super
for product that costs as much as this one does expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does
made very sturdy
worked great
the ear buds only play music in one ear
dont waste your money
will order from them again
if you plan to use this in car forget about it
found this product to be too big
best ve found so far ve tried other and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using
m very disappointed with my decision
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
definitely bargain
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was good purchase
received my supposedly new motorola and apparently there was not match between the phone and the charger
pros good camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more
that s huge design flaw unless m not using it correctly which do n t think is the case
love my headset my bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is comfortable fit
the camera although rated at an impressive megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such relatively high resolution
this for the car charger and it does not work
sound quality on both end is excellent use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful
its little geeky but think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case
great product fast shipping
absolutely great
the keyboard is nice compromise between full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad
got this phone around the end of may and m completely unhappy with it
it is very comfortable on the ear
it has been winner for us
setup could n t have been simpler
ve tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ve found that fits my ear comfortably
could not get strong enough signal
iam very pleased with my purchase
bad quality
gets the job done
great audio
basically the service was very bad
it did not work in my cell phone plug am very up set with the charger
ve only had my bluetooth for few weeks but really like it
the bt headset was such
it is so small and you do n t even realize that it is there after while of getting used to it
the accompanied software is almost brilliant
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage
recommend
buyer be very careful
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed
very good stuff for the price
my headset works just peachy keen
in my house was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
voice recognition is tremendous
what waste
during several different minute calls experienced drops and it was in an area that had bars
was not happy with this item
very disappointed
the phone takes forever to charge like to hours literally
got this phone on from relative and m glad did
what waste of time
its reception is very very poor
items stated as included from the description are not included
after months screen just went black all of sudden
was hoping for more
audio quality is poor very poor
had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my blackberry curve
know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that would n t work well well this one works great
ve bought wired headphones that sound better than these
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones have used
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there
this item is fantastic and works perfectly
and just love the colors
is just superb
all can do is whine on the internet so here it goes the more use the thing the less like it
great charger
this is essentially communications tool that does not communicate
works like charm it work the same as the one got with the phone
still maintain that monkeys should n t make headphones we just obviously do n t share enough dna to copy the design over to humans
great value
does n t work at all it for my and its not working
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics
does n t last long
one thing hate is the mode set button at the side
excellent service
thank you for wasting my money
how can that be the audio quality is poor
the igo chargers and tips are really great
the file browser offers all the options that one needs handsfree is great
superb phone on great network
connected my wife s bluetooth motorola to my phone and it worked like charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case
put the latest os on it and it now likes to slow to crawl and lock up every once in while
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device
if you like loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
do n t buy this product
ve had this headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome
have this phone and it is thorn in my side really abhor it
recently had problems where could not stay connected for more than minutes before being disconnected
incredible
design flaw
great phone
waste of bucks
but when check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off few seconds into the first message and then m lost
the replacement died in few weeks
any ring tone overall good phone to buy
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone
have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more
not impressed
light weight hardly notice it is there
you ll love how thin it is
bad choice
the pleather case does n t fit
useless phone simply deaf
the color is even prettier than thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp
all in all think it was good investment
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters
battery lasts only few hours
great headset very impressed
the mega pixel camera being part of phone is reasonably
ve had this for nearly years and it has worked great for me
good transmit audio
we are sending it back
did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but learned the lesson that should not have bought this form online anyway
if you hate avoid this phone by all means
great price also
the range is very decent ve been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception sound quality issues
fast service
would highly recommend this
would recommend this
also did n t like the on button it felt like it would crack with use
worst phone ever
m still infatuated with this phone
freezes
it s kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it s embarrassing how child like the company is
simple lightweight and great fit
all in all d expected better consumer experience from motorola
there s horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that have never experienced before
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent
usually do n t like headbands but this one is very lightweight does n t mess up my hair
m bit disappointed
have had this phone for over year now and will tell you its not that great
ordered this for sony ericsson but think it only worked once thats when first used it
the battery is completely useless to me
what big waste of time
do n t waste your on this one
great sound and service
really pleased with this product so far
one of my favorite purchases ever
best bluetooth on the market
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort recommend you this case
was very excited to get this headset because thought it was really cute
do not make the same mistake as me
big disappointment with calendar sync
the phone was unusable and was not new
worst customer service ever
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever
it defeats the purpose of bluetooth headset
worth every penny
excellent wallet type phone case
nice headphones for the price and they work great
internet is slow
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using case
it s fits like glove and is strong secure and durable
my gosh the best phone have ever had
it s very attractive and appears to be of good quality
love all the features and form factor
this product had strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after while and caused me to return it
poor quality and service
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary
great earpiece
excellent hands free tool
great for using with your home stereo
good product incredible value
only had this month but it s worked flawlessly so far
works great
junk
that one did n t work either
battery life is real good
returned hours later
it s great item
do n t waste your money
love this headset
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it
worked perfectly
unreliable m giving up
gave it stars because of the sound quality
avoid this one if you can
reversible plug works great
wasted my little money with this earpiece
very good phone
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful
comfort for our whole family
good product good seller
love this bluetooth
first of all it does n t wear well
am very impressed with this headset from plantronics
got it because it was so small and adorable
great phone
would n t recommend buying this product
piece of junk
poorly hinge
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
great phone
do n t buy it
excellent phone
do not purchase this phone
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent
this is hands down the best phone ve ever had
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen
this one works and was priced right
customer service was terrible
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor
sending it back
now know that made wise decision
someone invented this sooner
good price
everything worked on the first try the device was certainly engineered in clever way and the construction feels good
received it quickly and it works great
has been working great
as many people complained found this headset s microphone was very weak
my old nokia from tracfone holds the charge lot better than this
they do not care about the consumer one bit
this is good battery and it got here really fast
the instruction manual is lacking
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena
it s uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg
we have gotten lot of compliments on it
this is definitely must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving
want my money back
love this device
am also very happy with the price
ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately
the is still lacking in earbuds
was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem
have bars on my cell phone when am home but you cant not hear anything
good item low price
however the are not the best and neither are the games
the plug did not work very well
amazon sucks
rip off over charge shipping
very comfortable
the battery is working well as replacement for the original that came with the phone over years ago
the reception is excellent
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts couple of days
very clear quality sound and you do n t have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset
long lasting battery you do n t have to recharge it as as some of the flip phones
obviously there is problem with the adhesive
very disappointing
it was an inexpensive piece but would still have expected better quality
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after bought it
excellent sound quality
was not happy
piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for days
new battery works great in phone
worst customer service
ve dropped my phone more times than can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood
reception is terrible and full of static
good audio quality
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life whole lot easier
was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal
were jerks on the phone
works like charm works as advertised
comfortable nice range good battery life
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible
excellent starter wireless headset
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing
the only thing that think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset
first off the reception sucks have never had more than bars ever
the phone gets extremely hot
the microphone also works well but according to people have called it everything
nice design and quality
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission
bad fit way too big
it definitely was not as good as my
awesome device
waste of money
had ordered motorola data cable got very well finished and working product
love this phone
was looking for this headset for long time and now that ve got it could n t be happier
ll be along and my headset starts ringing for no reason
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year
battery life is also great
the worst phone ve ever had only had it for few months
not good item it worked for while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if try to push the ear plug into my ear
protects the phone on all sides
this is very average phone with bad battery life that operates on weak network
clear skype calls long battery life long range
soyo technology sucks
great hands free device
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool
same problem as others have mentioned
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well
magical help
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service
poor sound quality
the best phone in market
it worked very well
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well
exactly what wanted
the picture resolution is far below what other comparably priced phones are offering today
this is great deal
excellent product am very satisfied with the purchase
highly recommend these and encourage people to give them try
better than you d expect
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear
great product and price
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple
still waiting m sure this item would work well if ever recieve it
what disappointment
very prompt service
excellent product for the price
very pleased with this headset
do n t waste your money and time
especially love the long battery life
it s so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time new phone comes out
works great
plantronics bluetooth buy
came over from verizon because has nicer cell phones the first thing noticed was the really bad service
ll be looking for new earpiece
highly recommend this device to everyone
jawbone era is awesome too
we received white colored battery that goes dead after couple original used to last week but still lasts longer than
after year the battery went completely dead on my headset
have used several phone in two years but this one is the best
an awesome new look for fall
this is the first phone ve had that has been so cheaply made
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip
price is good too
do n t make the same mistake did
oh and forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone
m using it with an iriver with case and it fits fine
also the area where my unit broke m not too fond of the magnetic strap
overall am psyched to have phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it
another note about this phone s appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model
it s really easy
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect
fantastic earphones
it finds my cell phone right away when enter the car
low quality
highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ve had before
warning stay away
wish could return the unit and get back my money
device works great
used to talk on it for hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying
if you do n t find it too bad as again the unit comes with one only would not recommend this to anyone
very displeased
might have gotten defect but would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
restored my phone to like new performance
would recommend purchasing the jabra series which works flawlessly with my moto go figure
searched the internet and found this one to be the best value
does not fit
very happy with this product
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for camera phone
there s really nothing bad can say about this headset
m glad found this product on amazon it is hard to find it was n t high priced
portable and it works
my colleague now get great reception little expensive but performance is great
even fully charged it before went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi fi and noticed that it only had left in the morning
ve also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which always turn it on and then off again
not good when wearing hat or sunglasses
timely shipment and quality product
nice solid keyboard
very well made and fits my surefire perfectly
horrible phone
battery junk
we would recommend these to others
cant get the software to work with my computer
disappointed
poor voice clarity
the battery works great
no buyers remorse on this one
very disappointed in
find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers
looks great and is strong
have had service for or years now and am pretty happy with it
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
disappointment hate anything that goes in my ear
great software for
the delivery was on time
very easy to use
uncomfortable in the ear do n t use with lg env
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to destination unknown
it holds charge for long time is reasonably comfortable under long wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous
d like to return it
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough do n t expect any problems
verizon s bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple
after charging overnight these batteries work great
you wo n t regret it
love this phone
disappointment
its not user friendly
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving call is rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect
then exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute
this pda rocks
it is super charged up for use as small hybrid palmtop camera cellphone and excels in those roles
would definitely recommend the jabra for those who are looking for comfort clarity and great price
had verizon years ago and really liked their service
pretty piece of junk
plug was the wrong size
works as described
save your money ve had this item for months now
bad purchase
well im satisfied
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for nyc commuter
this battery is an excellent bargain
defective crap
would have given no star if was able
wear glasses and it fits fine with them
the sound quality for the device is unacceptable unless you are in really quiet area you almost hear nothing
would not recommend this item to anyone
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
great no problems at all
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not
the sound is clear and the people talk to on it are amazed at the quality too
got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well it has protected my handheld perfectly so far
very good product well made
mobile phone tools are must have
am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone
received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall am very excited to have this source
the phone is sturdy and waterproof
am not impressed with this and would not recommend this item to anyone
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is little low even when turned up to of
thanks again to amazon for having the things need for good price
ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead
had to go to store and bought new nokia phone which is working great
works great
really ugly
horrible had to switch times
the noise shield is
no real improvement
razr battery good buy
keep up the good work amazon
they refuse to refund or replace
unfortunately it s easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
so basically threw my money out the window for nothing
great case and price
all it took was one drop from about inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked am not impressed and am not laughing
bluetooth range is good few days ago left my phone in the trunk got call and carried the conversation without hitch
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place
the channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly
am glad purchased it
ve missed numerous calls because of this reason
perhaps my phone is defective but people can not hear me when use this
do n t buy this product
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even scratch nothing could n t be more happier with my new one for the droid
worst software ever used if could give this zero stars would
trying to make call on these is an exercise in frustration
the case is flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever
own jabra and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better
love the camera it s really pretty good quality
thank you for such great service
its total package
the seller is very understanding and patient would definitely buy from them again
give star will contact cingular at and inform them of this practice
it s aggravating
great product for the price
have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone
none of it works just do n t buy it
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire s insert was poorly super glued and slid off
please dont waste your money
all in all m quite satisfied with this purchase
if you are looking for good quality motorola headset keep looking this is n t it
yet continues to use the same flawed charger design
results
cumbersome design
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then expected
great product
it s piece of crap
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which hated
this fixes all the problems
worst ever
am very happy
ve had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions
can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what
the battery life is highly unacceptable
that company is joke
it does everything the description said it would
due to this happening on every call was forced to stop using this headset
it works great with car charger especially if you can not plug in two adapters at the same time
verizon tech support walked my through few procedures none of which worked and ended up having to do hard re set wiping out all my data
voice quality signal strength dropped calls
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it s not
better than expected
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them
battery is holding up well
also difficult to put on d recommend avoiding this product
only used it two days and it was n t always easy to hear with
got the car charger and not even after week the charger was broken went to plug it in and it started smoking
sprint terrible customer service
linked to my phone without effort
they are so cool
easy to use
better than new
what me to get this junk have no idea
piece of trash
pretty good product
this is great phone
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which would highly recommend
their research and development division obviously knows what they re doing
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
those phones are working just fine now
am more than happy with this product
poor construction
this is infuriating
overall would recommend this phone over the new walkman
sprint charges for this service
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on
it does n t work in europe or asia
clipping this to your belt will make you feel like cent s up and coming
like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and is pretty to wear hours day without pain in the ear
was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at fraction of the price
the worst phone from samsung crap this crappy samsung is the worst have ever
the charger worked for about week and then completely stopped charging my phone
poor product
however needed some better instructions
you need two hands to operate the screen this software interface is decade old and can not compete with new software designs
worked very well paired with treo and as skype headset on my pc using usb bluetooth transceiver
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm pens which come in three pack
do not buy do not sucks
this is great product sure beats using your fingers
plus seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
all the other cases ve tried normally fall apart after few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul
very performance
do n t make the same mistake that did and please do n t buy this phone
this phone might well be the worst ve ever had in any brand
case was more or less an extra that originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear
recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell players in the family
do n t bother go to the store
posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but have the fire red and it s great color
did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed
you get what you pay for guess
not only did the software do great job of this could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection
im surprised this is good quality car charger and there s not much reviews about it
these are fabulous
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like first person shooters since the audio delay messes me up
used free program you can find on the internet to transfer data to the phone the price of the cable was excellent
disappointing accessory from good manufacturer
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
very wind resistant
obviously they have terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replace easy to operate and the sound is much better than others have tried
contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if could n t produce my receipt was out of luck
linksys should have some way to exchange bad phone for unit or something
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are
great phone
when placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was lot of extra room on the sides
m pleased
battery is terrible
found the product to be easy to set up and use
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavy it keeps falling out of my ear
utter crap sound quality is terrible
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work
no ear loop needed it s tiny and the sound is great
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and could not use it any longer on the visor
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo reboots overall still rate this device high
talk about useless customer service
it felt too light and tinny
this does not fit the palm tungsten and it broke the first time tried to plug it in
m happy about this purchase good quality and low price
love the look and feel of samsung
its well designed and very sharp the blue is very nice color
does everything it should and more
could not recommend these more
nice sound
looks good in the picture but this case was huge disappointment
much less than the jawbone was going to replace it with
setup went very smoothly
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it
must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
it is well made easy to access the phone and has handy detachable belt clip
then had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
ca n t upload ringtones from third party
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked
truly awful
it works fine on my motorola cellphone and lot better than the worn out battery did
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud
and none of the tones is acceptable
camera color balance is awful
this product is clearly not ready for prime time do n t care how cool it looks if you ca n t tell call is coming in it s worthless
love the ringtones because they are so upbeat
chinese forgeries abound
easy to pair with my samsung cell
the instructions did n t explain that microphone jack could be used
would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
too bad you have to pay up to month for the service
works well
the nokia usb cable did not work with my phone
clear crisp sound
have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well
the biggest complaint have is the battery drains superfast
the design might be ergonomic in theory but could not stand having these in my ear
do not buy if you want to use the holster
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips
it does n t make you look cool
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at time if not for an entire day
also the phone does n t seem to accept anything except cbr preferably ripped by windows media player
you ca n t beat the price on these
comes with strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously
lightweight and works well
so just beware
love this cable it allows me to connect any mini usb device to my pc
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up
bought this phone as replacement for my startac and have regretted it since
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my
ca n t store anything but phone numbers to sim
it lasts less than minutes if actually try to use the phone my wife has the same phone with the same problem
poor quality
jabra ear gels the best
not worth it
the phone crashed completely and now have to get it replaced
it quit working after d used it for about months so just purchased another one because this is the best headset ve ever owned
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc
it was great phone
if you simply want small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet
my phone does n t slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality
think it over when you plan to own this one this sure is the last moto phone for me
in the span of an hour had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv
have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is functional
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is good shape
it has everything need and could n t ask for more
after receiving and using the product for just days it broke
this product is great it makes working lot easier can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears
t mobile has the best customer service anywhere
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold
we have tried units and they both failed within months pros
provides good protection and looks classy too
always good
the is user friendly and makes it easy etc
the design is very good
great reception all the time
would highly recommend this product
could n t use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing
if you like loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
stay away from this store be careful
this hands free phone speaker is awesome
does not fit
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time
disappointing
blue ant is easy to use
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item
the camera on the phone may be used as dustpan when indoors d rather be using disposable then this
then few days later the puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use
it s very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother
the nano stated it my son was dissapointed
the sound quality is excellent as well
its the best headset have used
would not
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti glare screen protector that have found to date
just what wanted
this particular model would not work with my motorola smartphone
wont work right or atleast for me
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems bottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it
really wanted the plantronics to be the right one but it has too many issues for me the good
great product
crisp and clear
after the first charge kept going dead after minutes
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor
get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones have not had this problem
the reception has been generally good
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot
great bluetooth
highly recommend this case
worthwhile
this is great deal
after my phone got to be about year old it s been slowly breaking despite much care on my part
am sorry made this purchase
bought these hoping could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear
treo and t mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
it was horrible
do n t think it would hold it too on your belt
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first
they work about weeks then break
it is simple to use and like it
it s great tool for entertainment communication and data management oh be sure to use activesync for optimal data synchronization results
ca n t use this case because the smell is disgusting
not what wanted
own of these cases and would order another
great phone
bought this battery with coupon from amazon and m very happy with my purchase
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
perfect for the
five star plus plus
good quality bargain bought this after bought from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end could n t hear me
down the drain
tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and was still told it was n t great
good works fine
for the price this was great deal
great price too
if there is wind it is completely useless
yes it s shiny on front side and love it
does not work
at first thought was good deal at until plugged it into my phone razr
the reception through this headset is excellent
thumbs up to this seller
have verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds feet line of sight
improper description had to return it
it works it is comfortable
battery charge life is quite long
the jabra fit my ears very well
battery has no life
checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing
product is exactly as described
gets signal when other verizon phones wo n t
does n t do the job
would recommend it
plan on ordering from them again and again
that being said for phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well
have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ve had numerous palms too
awkward to use and unreliable
the shipping time was also very quick
not as good as had hoped
good case
does n t work
really good product
unfortunately it did not work
all three broke within two months of use
dont buy it
my father has the and the battery is dying
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week lost one
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently
horrible horrible protector
do n t like this nokia either
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where expect them to be
have bought this nokia cell phone few weeks ago and it was nightmare
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone
terrible my car will not accept this cassette
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the cellphones was planning to use it with
it s not what it says it is
stay away from the
used and dirty
very unreliable service from t mobile
not good enough for the price
bought two of them and neither will charge
it looks very nice
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone s auto answer
have read other s reviews here but have n t had any problem with it
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
comfortable in my hand
just does not work
poor reliability
it works
if take picture the battery drops bar and starts beeping letting me know its
terrible product and waste of money
last time buying from you
it was waste of my money
so far it has worked like charm
have only had it for few weeks but so far so good
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone
would recommend this item
it s been my choice headset for years great sound good volume good noise cancellation
nice case feels good in your hands
the item received was counterfeit
just really good so far probably the best bt headset have ever had
works fine
received my headset in good time and was happy with it
was very pleased to see that could replace my well swivel holster for my blackberry flip
my sister has one also and she loves it
good quality
this is by far the worst purchase ve made on amazon
excellent dual purpose headset
excellent
does not work for listening to music with the cingular
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside
the line another worthless cheap gimmick from sprint
having trouble with volume
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears
warning do not buy
am pairing this with my iphone and could not be happier with it so far
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off
did n t want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort
best headset ever
do n t trust their website and do n t expect any helpful support
it was that loud glad to say that the plantronics maintains flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips
excellent product for the price
bad reception
this product is very high quality chinese crap
it was quite comfortable in the ear
great phone
do n t buy this product it fails
everything about this product is wrong first
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took couple minutes before started making calls with the voice dialing feature
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose couple of very very important contacts
terrible phone holder
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly
love being able to use one headset for both by land line and cell
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product
how stupid is that
can hear while m driving in the car and usually do n t even have to put it on it s loudest setting
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors
good show samsung
so bought about of these and saved alot of money
it always cuts out and makes beep beep beep sound then says signal failed
could n t figure it out
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wife s phone was almost totally unintelligible she could n t understand word being said on it
so had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
while managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop
leopard print is wonderfully wild
works for me
saggy floppy piece of junk
much better than the hard plastic cases
it also had new problem
happy so far
cool phone
works good
motorola finally got the voice quality of bluetooth headset right
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within couple feet between the two
but it is great would really recommend it
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when m not wearing it
as said above pretty useless
never got it
this pair of headphones is the worst that have ever had sound wise
down the drain because of weak snap
does not charge the cingular att phone
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off
however after about year the started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and could n t receive and place calls
kept catching the cable on the seat and had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
the headset fulfills my requirements so am happy with my purchase
logitech bluetooth headset is
like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside
lot of websites have been rating this very good phone and so do
have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine
the mic there is joke and the volume is quite low
m returning them
does not maintain connection with the computer while it is on my lap
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite
have had mine for about year and this christmas bought some for the rest of the family
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound
nice leather
had to purchase different case
it is joy to use
very much disappointed with this company
very satisifed with that
it did n t charge for me
this is the phone to get for just bought my and all can say is wow
buttons are too small
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow
love it great armband
really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic
however the keypads are so tinny that sometimes reach the wrong buttons
exchanged the sony ericson for this and m pretty happy with that decision
was very impressed with the price of the cases
also makes it easier to hold on to
use this product in motor control center where there is lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great
it s pretty easy
can not make calls at certain places
however my girl was complain that some time the phone does n t wake up like normal phone does
beautiful styling though
this company charge me restocking fee and still not given me my refund back
m trying to return it for refund
plugged it in only to find out not darn thing worked
excellent product
earbud piece breaks easily
lousy product
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it s very ability to be phone
it is the best charger have seen on the market yet
sweetest phone
oh the charger seems to work fine
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal
not enough volume
echo problem very unsatisfactory
you could only take videos at time and the quality was very poor
do n t waste your money
am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product
adapter does not provide enough charging current
there was so much hype over this phone that assumed it was the best my mistake
you also can not take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered
phone falls out easily
it did n t work people can not hear me when talk
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use
m really disappointed all have now is charger that does n t work
painful on the ear
lasted one day and then blew up
disappointed
kind of flops around
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face
what piece of junk lose more calls on this phone
item does not match picture
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
very very very slow moving aimless movie about distressed drifting young man
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent
very little music or anything to speak of
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find song that keeps running through his head
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it s about emptiness it works guess because it s empty
wasted two hours
saw the movie today and thought it was good effort good messages for kids
bit predictable
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher
and those baby owls were adorable
the movie showed lot of florida at it s best made it look very appealing
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious
it was so cool
this is very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face
it had some average acting from the main person and it was low budget as you clearly can see
this review is long overdue since consider tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made
ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making
it s practically perfect in all of them true masterpiece in sea of faux masterpieces
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema
can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill dozen other films
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from movie than this
it s quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable
yes this film does require rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create beautiful picture
this short film certainly pulls no punches
graphics is far from the best part of the game
this is the number one best th game in the series
it deserves strong love
it is an insane game
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it s just massive game
waste your money on this game
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly
actually the graphics were good at the time
today the graphics are crap
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye
this game rocks
buy it play it enjoy it love it
it s pure brilliance
this was flick doomed from its conception
the very idea of it was lame take minor character from mediocre film and make complete non sequel while changing its tone to pg rated family movie
was n t the least bit interested
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and m not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer
but it s just not funny
but even the talented carrell ca n t save this
his co stars do n t fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted
the story itself is just predictable and lazy
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work ve ever seen
but whatever it was that cost them so much it did n t translate to quality that s for sure
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget
m glad the film did n t go for the most obvious choice as lesser film certainly would have
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen
it s hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl
on the negative it s insipid enough to cause regret for another hours of life wasted in front of the screen
long whiny and pointless
but recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go
excellent cast story line performances
totally believable
anne heche was utterly convincing
sam shepard s portrayal of gung ho marine was sobering
sat riveted to the tv screen
all in all give this one resounding out of
do think tom hanks is good actor
enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little
was very disappointed in the movie
one character is totally annoying with voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on chalkboard
there is totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters
this movie totally grates on my nerves
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they re delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good
and quite honestly often its not very good
often the dialogue does n t really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly
there are some generally great things in it
would n t say they re worth hours of your time though
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from to pg
especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections
if you want movie that s not gross but gives you some chills this is great choice
alexander nevsky is great film
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived
m glad this pretentious piece of s did n t do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it s gon na help movie makers who are n t in the very restrained movie business of qu bec
this if the first movie ve given to in years
if there was ever movie that needed word of mouth to promote this is it
overall the film is interesting and thought provoking
plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time
give this one look
gave it
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted
it is true classic
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go
definitely worth checking out
the problem was the script
it was horrendous
there was nothing believable about it at all
the only suspense was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were
manna from heaven is terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going
the cast of veteran actors are more than just nostalgia trip
ursula burton s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church
if you are looking for movie with terrific cast some good music including shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one try
do n t think you will be disappointed
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere
it was too predictable even for chick flick
too politically correct
very disappointing
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful
love lane but ve never seen her in movie this lousy
an hour and half wish could bring back
but in terms of the writing it s very fresh and bold
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better and it is real joy to watch
the directing and the cinematography are n t quite as good
the movie was so boring that sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during columbo movie before
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that had to look away
the directing seems too pretentious
the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are misplace
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid
some applause should be given to the prelude however
really liked that
great film by great director
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night
the music in the film is really nice too
d advise anyone to go and see it
brilliant
liked this movie way too much
my only problem is thought the actor playing the villain was low rent michael ironside
it rocked my world and is certainly must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets
however this did n t make up for the fact that overall this was tremendously boring movie
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and could n t understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by
there were several moments in the movie that just did n t need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving
this was poor remake of my best friends wedding
all in all great disappointment
can not believe that the actors agreed to do this film
could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i
guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on
imdb ratings only go as low for awful it s time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these
saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination
all the pretty pictures in the world can not make up for piece of work that is flawed at the core
it is an hour and half waste of time following bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life
you ca n t relate with them hell you barely can understand them
this is definitely cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others
this movie is pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst have seen it confuses you incredibly
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated thousand times in the film
truly truly bad film
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as fodder
paid too much
also it s real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse
it was so boring
no plot whatsoever
again no plot at all
horrible
worst hour and half of my life oh my gosh
had to walk out of the theatre for few minutes just to get some relief
hate movies like that
yeah the movie pretty much sucked
there is no plot or storyline
if you do go see this movie bring pillow or girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupied through out
awful
do n t think ve ever gone to movie and disliked it as much
it was good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because would be mad if d have paid to see this crap
nobody identifies with these characters because they re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes
this is bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who ca n t handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling picture painted with crayons
crash is depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things
still do like this movie for it s empowerment of women there s not enough movies out there like this one
your brain will attempt to shut down as part of primal impulse of self preservation
was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and took good two hours to fully recover
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and as part of the hellish trinity of horror films
certainly do not mean this distinction in good way
mean this in terrible way
this film has no redeeming features
everything is appalling
artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i
the story is beyond stupid
the script is was there script
the kids are annoying
the lead man is charisma free
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture
ll even say it again this is torture
maybe there would be reasonable explanation for this atrocity
not pleasant voyage of self discovery
highly
if this premise sound stupid that s because it is
yes it s that bad
nothing at all to recommend
an excellent performance from ms
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix does n t seem to be stocking them
it s also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion has n t missed step going from silent to sound
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense
there were too many close ups
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes did n t really work for their freedom
but this movie is definitely below average rent
you ll love it
this movie is bad
so bad
the film is way too long
this is definitely one of the bad ones
the movie received was great quality film for it s age
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him
think that it is must see older john wayne film
really do n t see how anyone could enjoy this movie
do n t think ve ever seen movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk
it probably would have been better if the director had n t spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really is n t that noteworthy
another thing did n t really like is when character got punched in the face gallon of blood would spew forth soon after
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles
his performance is simply genius
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner s daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire
in fact it s hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself
ray charles is legendary
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about musician
hitchcock is great director
ironically mostly find his films total waste of time to watch
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie
it s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films
hence the whole story lacks certain energy
the plot simply rumbles on like machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws
mishima is extremely uninteresting
this is chilly unremarkable movie about an author living working in chilly abstruse culture
the flat reenactments do n t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of movie quicker than anyone else
schrader has made resume full of lousy amateurish films
when first watched this movie in the loved it
was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything
however recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was
mean in realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic
the character developments also lacked in depth
woa talk about awful
do not waste your time
it was just too horrible
the worst dialogue could go on and on
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction
the poor actors
you ca n t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action
if you check the director s filmography on this site you will see why this film did n t have chance
this would not even be good as made for tv flick
if good intentions made film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made
the film has great actors master director significant theme at least would be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care
regrettably the film fails
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie
yet enjoy watching it
unfortunately this is bad movie that is just plain bad
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad
the dialogue sucked
the cinematography if it can be called that sucked
the soundtrack sucked
the acting sucked
the concert sequences just sucked
that was nice
that was funny
it was so funny
overall this movie was cheap trash
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it
came out of it feeling angry
spoilers whatever else can or ca n t be said about it surface is superbly crafted
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art
conceptually the show offers little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and or fx fans
and there was n t single sour note struck acting wise either some surprisingly solid casting here
all things considered job very well done
thanks good movie like this was done and released
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it
it ranks highly as great noir crime drama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film
up there with the best of melville
everything about this film is simply incredible
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of child
black water is thriller that manages to completely transcend it s limitations it s an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience
the performances are real and gripping the is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that s because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous
thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series
m not sure what he was trying to do with this film
if it was to turn my good day feeling into night of disturbing memories than guess he succeeded
there is lot of beautiful places
it was forced like everything in this movie
again lame
here s where the movie really pi ed me off
and do n t even get me started on the jerky camerawork
when saw it in the theater thought was going to be sick
summary the witticisms were n t witty
the plot well said d let that one go
the acting was bad
really bad
even billy bob could n t rise above the script which was worse
camerawork again bad
rating out of
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like work of art
three of the most visually appealing movies ve ever seen
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome
have to mention this and it is huge spoiler loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years
could n t think of better way to end the film but smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy
recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything work of art
out of for both the movie and trilogy
literally vomited while watching this film
think was one of the people who found this another one of roth s pearls
his performance as awarded was stunning
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop
in most wonderful location lies story of contrast
all in all beautiful directed film from nicola s roeg wih sublime cast
m translating movies for living and this is the first movie in my working experience that found offensive to my intelligence
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers muddled and often ridiculous story bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful can only say it s your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it s in our human nature to try and make sense of things
one more thing can tolerate political incorrectness very well m all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much
this is such fun and funny movie
highly entertaining at all angles
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous
it even has its sweet moments
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played
and really did find them funny
this is actually very smart movie
there is brilliant twist ending
love it
the ending is so so perfect you ll shed tear
am so thrilled after seeing movie like this
will never forget it now
it is not just cult it is cult classic
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue
this movie is terrible
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they re years old goalies diving at shots that are feet wide of the net etc
for those that have n t seen it do n t waste your time
to call this movie drama is ridiculous
started watching this but did n t believe in any of the characters
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did n t work for me at all
it was very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that was watching play rather than film
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was lot like stage farce
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant was bored and did n t care what happened next and so switched off
glad did n t pay to see it
did n t laugh or even smile once
but it was n t anything at all just one big yawn
it is really good show to watch
it is very educational for children to years old
barney is definitely super de duper
is pretty funny
bop is very cute
the kids are very cool too
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies
it s just lame
the guy who said he s had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right
everything about this movie is stupid
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie
it is shameful
would give this television series plus if could
the writers were smack on and think the best actors and actresses were bonus to the show these characters were so real
must say have taped most of the episodes and find myself watching them over and over again
now you know why gave it
do n t know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become special part of our family s memories
totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy
everything from acting to cinematography was solid
definitely worth checking out
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen
this movie has cutting edge to it
am so pleased to know such modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him
the new characters were n t all that memorable and found myself forgetting who was who
felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever
it did n t make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying
the jerky camera movements were also annoying
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror
there was few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it did n t really work into the rest of the plot
guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
elias koteas jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this very enjoyable movie with good acting and decent budget
this was such an awesome movie that bought it off of ebay
really loved the story line and the bear was kinda cute but if anyone has question about fort steele just ask away
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole minutes of utter torture probably looked at my watch about times
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for minutes
god and can never get that minutes back
think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazing stylized beautiful and effective
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art
after watching this film wanted to learn more about the works of this artist
highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history
here in the wind and the lion we see wonderful rendering of america s own imperial age
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy and vivid history
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery s noble brigand candace bergen s feisty heroine john huston s wily john hay or steve s spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt s big stick
this is high adventure at its best
think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was schizophrenic in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt
my mother and brother had to do this when saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was very good imitation of this type of individual and was impressed
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on pedestal
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain
non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful
good commentary of today s love and undoubtedly film worth seeing
for people who are first timers in film making think they did an excellent job
it was very popular when was in the cinema good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs
it s feel good film and that s how felt when came out of the cinema
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents
rather enjoyed it
liked it
could n t take them seriously
it really created unique feeling though
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script
world better than of the garbage in the theatres today
her role was played well
not too not to masculine but just right
the camera really likes her in this movie
would have casted her in that role after ready the script
as european the movie is nice throwback to my time as student in the s and the experiences had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different
am fan of his this movie sucked really bad
even worse than ticker
that movie was bad
only like or buildings used couple of locations maybe poor
it just blew
this movie is excellent angel is beautiful and scamp is adorable his little yelps when hes scared and the funniest parts are when scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling before totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on june the cover has scamp on garbage can and angel underneath the lid
just cant explain this movie more than romantic charming hilarious and adorable the junkyard scenes are funny all the junkyard dogs have something special too funny laughed kids will love it buy it when it comes out it has new features
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich s to be admitted elsewhere
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round
wish could enter negative values admins
the sets are so bad they would n t look out of place on thunderbirds episode
the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from corn flakes box and directorial style that bordered on stupidity
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too
hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which really like the star but this film is so bad do n t believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it
am not filmmaker nor am director but would hide my head in the sand if d spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie
in short this was monumental waste of time and energy and would not recommend anyone to ever see this film
it came free with dvd player bought but still turned the thing off halfway through because was embarrassed for howell
and only because there is no setting for
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as dangerous nut bag side note d love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance in flick together talk about raging cheekbones
the soundtrack was n t terrible either
but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable
still it was the sets that got big on my oy vey scale
yes am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation
both do good jobs and are quite amusing
but the convoluted plot just did n t convince me and much of the film was watched with weird questioning glance
let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it
the last minutes of movie are also not bad as well
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than period universal movie
like armand assante my cable company s summary sounded interesting so watched it twice already and probably will again
believe the screenwriter did good job of tying up the loose ends
my score is mostly for the plot
wo n t say any more do n t like spoilers so do n t want to be one but believe this film is worth your time
wow what bad film
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible
the plot does n t hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling
not even good for camp value
was n t expecting oscar material but this
you d have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming
this film and use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative
this gets out of simply because there s nothing lower
this is one did not have but watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed
know he was contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving
the only thing worse than taylor s acting was stanwyck s singing
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely
was deeply impressed with the character he played
knew when saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor
cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in better tomorrow and some cheesy clich s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for few poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo
even the squibs look awful
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like mercy killing
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off real waste of space and time
was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense
about minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words
the directing is sloppy at best
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing
of course the acting is blah
the acting by the whole cast could be put on scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell
loved this movie it was great portrayal of family who had it s share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other
have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out years ago
this movie contained an all star cast and what loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who have n t seen before
this movie was kind of long in length but enjoyed every minute of it
overall rate this movie out of scale
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is must have
particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is film few get to see but those who do will remember it
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way
but this movie really got to me
see it
really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style
and forgot the casting here superb with trond g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who does n t understand where he is what he is doing and why
this movie is good and humorous comment on life in
found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me
later found myself lost in the power of the film
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film
left the theater with lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race
duris has wholesome appearance and gives fine performance
the rest of the cast also play well
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers
about ten minutes into this film started having second thoughts
about half way through this film started to dislike it
by the time the film ended not only disliked it despised it
what this film lacks is convincing script
the script looks as if only rough draft was written and shooting began before finished script was completed
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it
the cast is good
for that it s worth checking out
this is probably the most irritating show have ever seen in my entire life
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show have ever seen
everything about it is just bad
could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season
the script is bad very bad it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated or movie
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is really really bad actors period
final word this show is real torture
it is zillion times away from reality
watching washing machine twirling around would n t hurt your eyes as much as this show
rating grade note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show
century fox s road house is not only quite silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of movie
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect great deal more
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing
and if that is n t enough of mess of movie for you the picture is also marred with constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors
whatever prompted such documentary is beyond me
very serious spoilers this movie was huge disappointment
there are so many problems dont know where to start
the cast was great
steve martin delivers really funny performance of middle aged upper class uptight white guy
add betty white and jean smart and you have great cast everyone played their parts really well
but the movie makes lot of serious mistakes
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa s character
there is no real plot
wouldnt see this movie again for free
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking
while you do n t yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was huge crowd pleaser in
however after seeing the short again after about years was amazed at how timeless the film actually is
it s just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way
clever and real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among mickey s best films even after wonderful years
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer the next minute luv s diaper commercial is completely unconvincing
m terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there
the original body and soul is masterpiece
john garfield ann revere lilli william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe
do n t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake
this may be the only bad film he ever made
so bad well it s just bad
this movie is solid example of bad plot and very very bad idea all the way
it s shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make living in mess like this
thought it was bad
both films are terrible but to the credit of the version it was watchable
let s start with all the problems the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad
the script is big flawed mess
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it s established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing necklace containing piece of the meteorite
director paul matthews who also wrote directed the weak monster movie grim clearly does n t know how to pace his films
the movie is terribly boring in places
the lighting is awful
the film looks cheap and bland
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly does n t work here
the visual effects were awful
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god s sake
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful
okay like to consider myself fair critic so ll give credit where credit s due the creature effects were actually pretty cool
got ta love those close ups of slimy drooling teeth
to sum the film up breeders is terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus
not recommended
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing
aside from it s terrible lead this film has loads of other debits
understand that it s supposed to be cheap popcorn comedy but that does n t mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive
lewis black s considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the rating certainly wo n t allow
the film s sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer
the budget was evidently very limited
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up
was less expansive
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were great part of the original
generally it just lacked imagination
not recommended
is it possible for movie to get any worse than this
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep
beware this is not trashy cult movie this is trash period
ca n t believe there s even sequel to this
which is precisely why am giving it such bad review
being s child truly enjoyed this show and can proudly say that enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons
but tiny toons kept the s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created
the memories are murky but can only say that enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having true lead character
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called lead
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through
her lines seem to have been written by fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
perabo has nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of camera
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done
saw this movie and thought this is stupid movie
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be volcano in los angeles
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish
in conclusion will not bother with this movie because volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense
the story line is just awful
it s just painful
and the accents are absolutely abysmal
there s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit
do n t waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film
believe that pitch black was done well
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and think people will be surprised by who does and does n t make it
go watch it
omit watching this
very funny
my rating just out of
the characters are interesting and you really care for them
an instant classic with great soundtrack and catchy song during the ending credits
do n t miss it
this is masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet s bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more
mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is wonder and joy to behold
it s as continuously beautiful to look at as bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master s work
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
regardless the film fails on most levels
avoid at all costs
saw this film over christmas and what great film it was
thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic
had always known that errol flynn was brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and grew up watching his films as child
but it was n t until watched this film that realised how great he actually was
ll give this film out of
know that jim o connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull
he really did n t seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous did n t get involved with the guests
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding murdered spy kidnapped child nasty church foreign plot and some random taxidermists
jimmy stewart is as ever great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock s black and white low budget original
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master s stable
have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as typical sci fi film
excellently produced by one of sci fi s best producers scot vandiver
but it is entertaining nonetheless
it s campy sort of film that s joy to watch
there s barely boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts
the cast is always entertaining as usual
overall delight
this movie is so mind awful it could n t have even been created
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is bit iffy to say the least say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself
the least said about the acting the better
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa
believe every one should see this movie as think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid must rent view or see
do n t be afraid of subtitles its worth little aversion therapy
excellent performance
there still are good actors around
also great directing and photography
very true to shakespear and must for all shakespear fans
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final out brief candle out he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces human face which makes it the more interesting
helen baxendale is very credible lady macbeth who can be very at times and sometimes she just looks like naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one
this is witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa s finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such memorable and enjoyable cartoon
however paul schrader has indeed made film about mishima that is both superb complex
also notable is john bailey s fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola s dracula for which she received well deserved oscar
even allowing for poor production values for the time and the format some kind of mini series this is
unless you re just out to visually collect all extant films of austen s work you can skip this one
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne s sisters each do wonderful job with their roles
it is not good
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and
then the film just dropped the ball
this is stunning movie
raw and sublimely moving
it felt like very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on stage which plays on everyone s terror of white lie escalating to monstrous consequences
all of the main players are mesmerising
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else s judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike
julian fellowes has triumphed again
he s national treasure
go and see it
this is an excellent film
the aerial scenes were well done
it was also the right balance of war and love
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes difference
good film by great director
this is definitely one of the better documentaries have seen looking at family relationships and marriage
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe s glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact joe s facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene
this is just great movie
out of stars
ca n t see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
it s so bad it s actually worth seeing just for that reason
punishment park is brilliant piece of cinema
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates film like no other
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films
advise you to look out for it
you wont regret it
highly recommended a
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is
it s mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage
it s case of so bad it is laughable
very bad performance plays angela bennett computer expert who is at home all the time
it is film about nothing just pretext to show ridiculous action scenes
how awful she is
but she is still bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures
the results well are shame
delete this film from your mind
one of the worst shows of all time
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who are these actors
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was mercy killing for this horrible show
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors
lame would be the best way to describe it
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its disgrace to any self respecting there is
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong
you can find better movies at youtube
top line do n t waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever
that s how d describe this painfully dreary time waster of film
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ve seen
it is n t even an achievement as so bad it s good or so bad it s memorable movie
it s an empty hollow shell of movie
seriously it s not worth wasting your or your kid s time on
avoid avoid avoid
it will drive you barking mad
the transfers are very good
very nice and relaxing late night viewing
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title
some great music and terrific scenery
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here
happy wonderful feel good ending
the point is the journey journey that touches every member of the family
it s one of the movies need to see whenever it comes on tv never mind the fact that already have it memorized
nothing new there
that was done in the second movie
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy
the plot has more holes than pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted
what on earth is irons doing in this film
just saw this film and recommend it
it has very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good
very good film indeed about great and unconditional love
tom wilkinson s character is man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives performance that makes you feel the character s anguish and suffering
emily watson s character is very strong and she has only to give quick glance and you understand everything
despite the pans of reviewers liked this movie
in fact liked it better than interview with vampire and liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise s attempt
was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene
m big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice s style sensitivities and treatments
guess liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable
the football scenes at the end were perplexing
but thought his acting was skilled
meredith was better than all right
very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart
it is rare when film maker takes the time to tell worthy moral tale with care and love that does n t fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent
nine out of ten for truly lovely film
this early film from future lucio fulci is very good addition to the giallo sub genre
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early s
standout scene
this scene is very strong and unpleasant
technically the film is well made with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani particularly good is recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it s coming from distant hill
it s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end
liked the way dustin hoffman s character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son
this movie is also revealing
personally think it shows that people should learn to find compromise them self without involving other people into issue
and it was boring
am so tired of clich s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up
it s fresh subtle and rather sublime effect
an italian reviewer called this small great film and that s right
all the actors give wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star
you learn lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and lot about the movie business itself
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ve ever heard
you wo n t forget this movie
why was this film made
the film has an ultra cheap look to it
the result is film that just do n t look right
none of them are engaging or exciting
the plot is nonsense that does n t interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time
saw it as child on tv back in when it was the stranger and loved it
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr
this movie is so awesome
loved it it was really scary
love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there
if you want real scare rent this one
this is an extraordinary film
as courtroom drama it s compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it s frightening
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it s not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ve seen
this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets boost from the fine performance by cole
predictable but not bad watch
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part
she carries the movie well
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc it s all wrong
in fact this stinker smells like direct to video release
avoid at all costs
star trek the final frontier is the worst in the series
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on jet pack when he falls down from mountain
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dose n t bear thinking about which basically involves vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously just did n t care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does belly dance to distract male guards
the only place good for this film is in the garbage
the worst one of the series
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion
when song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way
of course the footage from the was grainy but that only enhanced the film
this film offers many delights and surprises
when achille and philippa beautifully sing duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film
the story unfolds in century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch
you share general s exquisite joy in his partaking of the en even though you are just watching movie but you do wish for just small sample to savor
but this understated film leaves lasting impression
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars
the acting as you d expect from this cast is top notch
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic
angus scrimm also turns in good performance in somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin playing anatomist doctor quinn
conclusion loved it
it s long time since was so entertained by movie
struggle to find anything bad to say about it
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with years down the line
it s pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that does n t insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism
plus with the movie s rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job
hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is proud black man who is accused of murdering white man in the south
trumbull on love lucy
see it with your kids if you have chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last years
see both films if you can
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce s acclaimed novella the dead
feelings thoughts gabriel s discomfort during the dance all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer s grasp in huston s portrayal
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist
it s very slow
lot of holes in the plot there s nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend years between his childhood and mature age
do n t waste your time
end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies ve ever seen
he surely does n t know how to make coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for big sum of money
this was one of the worst films have ever seen
m still trying to get over how bad it was
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you re looking for the be all end all of movies look no further
with great sound effects and impressive special effects ca n t recommend this movie enough
call me nut but think this is one of the best movies ever
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle
hour minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting mess of script and sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking
lots of holes in the script
it s like bad two hour tv movie
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong
the dialogue is atrocious
the acting is beyond abysmal
everything stinks
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make movie watchable like character story theme and so on
worse there s an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows little band of latter day as they go after reporter who s working on story on the anniversary of the killings
it s dumb and pointless and complete waste of time
in short do n t bother with this movie
wo n t spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing
the best scene in the movie is at the end but wo n t spoil it
if there was ever an indication of writer and director s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into seamless union of creativity then this is it
the result is powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture s disturbing fascination with celebrity and it s distorted interpretations of fame
film not easily forgotten
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman and totally believable because he is great actor
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years
the characters are interesting even if bit predictable
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular
great movie
also the story and acting were weak
at around pm bought it at around started to watch at around fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for human being with brain but there was n t
either way it sucks
the script is horrendously stupid
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid
what the hell kind of crap is that
then there s the plot holes
you could drive semi truck into these holes
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film
she s poised and amazing
dee snider just plain sucks
he ca n t act one of the least scary villains have ever seen he ca n t write did he write this damn movie in his sleep
was bored throughout the whole damn thing
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks
this film tries to be serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films have ever seen in my entire life
piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid
avoid at any and all costs
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies
avoid this film at all costs
do n t know what happened in season five what mess
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita as the two in quiet conflict
now this is movie really dislike
it s one of the most boring horror movies from the s mainly because it starts slow and centers in boring atmosphere
the puppets look really cheesy not in good way like in the puppet master s flicks
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets
there are n t death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible
felt asleep the first time watched it so can recommend it for insomniacs
the fact is this film is wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams
the best part about nurse betty is it s unpredictability
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next
otherwise do n t even waste your time on this
this one just fails to create any real suspense
as for the killer do n t expect anything original or even remotely frightening
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film
m so sorry but really ca n t recommend it to anyone
one of the most boring pointless movies have ever seen
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying
hated it
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed but not quite that bad
do n t understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it s not even real movie
highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
this is not movie making
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from book that s how bad it is
so am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen
saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it
did n t realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes
excellent short film
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into feature length film with the same cast or win us over with whole new film
agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad
characters are one dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys
the story line is totally predictable
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like sculpture
ve seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie
bad characters bad story and bad acting
really awful
not easy to watch
funny clever hip just like pray s previous film hype
it was long time that did n t see so charismatic actor on screen
paolo sorrentino has written wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for long time after the vision of the movie
rate this movie
do not know if this was emilio estevez s directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest natural eye
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki s films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children ever saw put on screen
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with
this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful
the story is also both funny and poignant at times
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie
this is truly an art movie it actually has lot of art in it
go rent it
however after finally watching this film realized that not only had had closed mind to the brilliance it depicts also found myself watching it over and over again
it s the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as try to attempt to decipher it s meanings
brilliance indeed
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels think you ll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you
think of the film being like dream
simply beautiful
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of childrens book writer who maybe has written subversive tract
it s gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of raver
it presents idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic
it s too bad that everyone else involved did n t share crowe s level of dedication to quality for if they did we d have far better film on our hands than this sub par mess
the movie seemed little slow at first
but it picked up speed and got right to the point
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget
enjoyed it
have recommended it to friends
was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering convincing sincere performance
their on screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine
the film s dialogue is natural real to life
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters
definitely worth seeing it s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness
hayao miyazaki s latest and eighth film for studio no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood
at time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney pixar s cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film
the art style has the appearance of crayon pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful
if you act in such film you should be glad that you re gon na drift away from earth as far as possible
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere
if you have n t choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you ve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time
still it makes up for all of this with super ending that depicts great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses
instead we got bore fest about whiny spoiled brat babysitting
then watched it again two sundays ago march and began to really enjoy it and this time taped the entire thing
it is very well acted and done tv movie
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and think she does superb job in this film
keep watching it over and over
it s sad movie but very good
if you have not seen this movie definitely recommend it
she is as lovely as usual this cutie
still it s quite interesting and entertaining to follow
recommend with confidence
this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and thoroughly enjoyed myself
it was riot to see hugo weaving play sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were hoot
the opening sequence of this gem is classic and the cat mouse games that follow are delight to watch
fans of the genre will be in heaven
lange had become great actress
it looked like wonderful story
never walked out of movie faster
just got bored watching lange take her clothes off
unfortunately any virtue in this film s production work was lost on regrettable script
in word it is embarrassing
exceptionally bad
all in all its an insult to one s intelligence and huge waste of money
wow loved this place
crust is not good
not tasty and the texture was just nasty
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices
now am getting angry and want my damn pho
it did n t taste that fresh
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under warmer
the fries were great too
great touch
service was very prompt
would not go back
the cashier had no care what so ever on what had to say it still ended up being overpriced
tried the cape cod chicken with cranberry mmmm
was disgusted because was pretty sure that was human hair
was shocked because no signs indicate cash only
highly recommended
waitress was little slow in service
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas
did not like at all
the blah
the food amazing
service is also cute
could care less the interior is just beautiful
so they performed
that s right the red velvet cake ohhh this stuff is so good
they never brought salad we asked for
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff
took an hour to get our food only tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed
the worst was the salmon sashimi
also there are combos like burger fries and beer for which is decent deal
this was like the final blow
found this place by accident and could not be happier
seems like good quick place to grab bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself favor and look elsewhere
overall like this place lot
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive
ample portions and good prices
poor service the waiter made me feel like was stupid every time he came to the table
my first visit to hiro was delight
service sucks
the shrimp tender and moist
there is not deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and did n t want to eat it for fear of getting sick
on positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register
the only thing did like was the prime rib and dessert section
it s too bad the food is so damn generic
the burger is good beef cooked just right
if you want sandwich just go to any firehouse
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with nice char on the outside
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table
their chow mein is so good
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers do n t enjoy their food
the portion was huge
loved it friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat lined excuse for restaurant
not much seafood and like strings of pasta at the bottom
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless
at least think to refill my water before struggle to wave you over for minutes
this place receives stars for their appetizers
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious
we d definitely go back here again
we are so glad we found this place
great food and service huge portions and they give military discount
always great time at dos gringos
update went back for second time and it was still just as amazing
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy
great way to finish great
the deal included tastings and drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected
really really good rice all the time
the service was meh
it took over min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk
guess should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but did n t use my common sense
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well
times very bad customer service
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well
today is the second time ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good
there is so much good food in vegas that feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties ca n t wait for the other person to ask to break up
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only others there eating
the turkey and roast beef were bland
this place has it
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like sugary disaster tailored to the palate of six year old
love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying
all have to say is the food was amazing
omelets are to die for
everything was fresh and delicious
in summary this was largely disappointing dining experience
it s like really sexy party in your mouth where you re outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again
best breakfast buffet
say bye bye to your tip lady
we ll never go again
will be back again
food arrived quickly
it was not good
on the up side their cafe serves really good food
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the mary s coming
best buffet in town for the price you can not beat it
loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious
this is one of the better buffets that have been to
so we went to and had fantastic afternoon
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got great deal
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing
will go back next trip out
sooooo good
real sushi lovers let s be honest yama is not that good
at least passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it was n t that busy
this is really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth visit
nice spicy and tender
good prices
check it out
it was pretty gross
ve had better atmosphere
kind of hard to mess up steak but they did
although very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was bit disappointing
just do n t know how this place managed to served the blandest food have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries
service was fine and the waitress was friendly
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he s ever eaten
we thought you d have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night
host staff were for lack of better word bitches
bland not liking this place for number of reasons and do n t want to waste time on bad reviewing ll leave it at that
phenomenal food service and ambiance
would n t return
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time m in vegas
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food
penne vodka excellent
they have good selection of food including massive meatloaf sandwich crispy chicken wrap tuna melt and some tasty burgers
the management is rude
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even
great subway in fact it s so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations
had seriously solid breakfast here
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants would love to dine at during weekend in vegas
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions
do n t do it
the waiter was n t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us
my husband and ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and was n t very tasty to me
nice blanket of moz over top but feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow
the service was little slow considering that were served by people servers so the food was coming in slow pace
give it thumbs down
we watched our waiter pay lot more attention to other tables and ignore us
my fianc and came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away
this is great restaurant at the mandalay bay
we waited for forty five minutes in vain
crostini that came with the salad was stale
some highlights great quality nigiri here
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean
this was different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender well as well flavored
ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time d had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago
this place is good
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale
came back today since they relocated and still not impressed
was seated immediately
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced
avoid at all cost
restaurant is always full but never wait
delicious
this place is hands down one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area
so do n t go there if you are looking for good food
ve never been treated so bad
bacon is hella salty
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed
the waitresses are very friendly
lordy the khao soi is dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter
perhaps caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but m not inspired to go back
the service here leaves lot to be desired
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining touch of coziness
not weekly haunt but definitely place to come back to every once in while
we literally sat there for minutes with no one asking to take our order
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor
also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having heart attack
dressed up to be treated so rudely
it was probably dirt
love this place hits the spot when want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor
ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined
interesting decor
what really like there is the crepe station
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top very original and very good
you can watch them preparing the delicious food
both of the egg rolls were fantastic
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing
had salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied
m not really sure how joey s was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine
the best place to go for tasty bowl of pho
the live music on fridays totally blows
ve never been more insulted or felt disrespected
very friendly staff
it is worth the drive
had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope could have dreamed of
food was great and so was the
the warm beer did n t help
great brunch spot
service is friendly and inviting
very good lunch spot
ve lived here since and this was the first and last time ve stepped foot into this place
the worst experience ever
must have been an off night at this place
the sides are mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn
if that bug never showed up would have given for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen
for about minutes we we re waiting for her salad when we realized that it was n t coming any time soon
my friend loved the salmon tartar
wo n t go back
extremely tasty
waitress was good though
soggy and not good
the jamaican mojitos are delicious
which are small and not worth the price
the food is rich so order accordingly
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take full shower unless you do n t mind being nude for everyone to see
the service was bit lacking
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepper and of course there is none at the tables
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad
loved the bacon wrapped dates
this is an unbelievable bargain
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special
as for the mains also uninspired
this is the place where first had pho and it was amazing
this wonderful experience made this place must stop whenever we are in town again
if the food is n t bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world s worst annoying drunk people
very very fun chef
ordered double cheeseburger got single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks
great place to have couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv s
if it were possible to give them zero stars they d have it
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayo well none of the rolls had sauces on them
d say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of s dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service
horrible do n t waste your time and money
now this dish was quite
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse
it was n t busy either also the building was freezing cold
like the other reviewer said you could n t pay me to eat at this place again
drinks took close to minutes to come out at one point
seriously flavorful delights folks
much better than the other sushi place went to in vegas
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood
based on the sub par service received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business wo n t be going back
owner s are really great people
there is nothing privileged about working eating there
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful
overall do n t think that would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that silently felt too
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty
we had at our table and the service was pretty fast
fantastic service here
as well would ve given godfathers zero stars if possible
they know how to make them here
very tough and very short on flavor
hope this place sticks around
have been in more than few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion
plus it s only bucks
the service was not up to par either
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time
just as good as when had it more than year ago
for self proclaimed coffee cafe was wildly disappointed
the platter is out of this world
you cant go wrong with any of the food here
you ca n t beat that
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff
the chefs were friendly and did good job
ve had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho
liked the patio and the service was outstanding
the goat taco did n t skimp on the meat and wow what flavor
think not again
had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so will not be getting that again
went to bachi burger on friend s recommendation and was not disappointed
service stinks here
waited and waited
this place is not quality sushi it is not quality restaurant
would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza
great pizza and salads
things that went wrong they burned the
we waited an hour for what was breakfast could have done times better at home
this place is amazing
hate to disagree with my fellow but my husband and were so disappointed with this place
waited hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did
just do n t know why they were so slow
the staff is great the food is and they have an incredible beer selection
live in the neighborhood so am disappointed wo n t be back here because it is convenient location
did n t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care
before go in to why gave star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing review
love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it
never again will be dining at this place
the food was excellent and service was very good
good beer drink selection and good food selection
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles
the potato chip order was sad could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around
food was really boring
good service check
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me
will never ever go back
as much as d like to go back ca n t get passed the atrocious service and will never return
in the summer you can dine in charming outdoor patio so very delightful
did not expect this to be so good
fantastic food
she ordered toasted english muffin that came out untoasted
the food was very good
never going back
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude
by this point my friends and had basically figured out this place was joke and did n t mind making it publicly and loudly known
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about you just ca n t go wrong
all the bread is made in house
the only downside is the service
also the fries are without doubt the worst fries ve ever had
service was exceptional and food was good as all the reviews
couple of months later returned and had an amazing meal
favorite place in town for
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal
you wo n t be disappointed
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for better overall dish but it was still very good
go to far too many places and ve never seen any restaurant that serves egg breakfast especially for
when my mom and got home she immediately got sick and she only had few bites of salad
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they do n t always honor pizza hut coupons
both of them were truly unbelievably good and am so glad we went back
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere
everything was gross
love this place
great service and food
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky
the burger got the gold standard burger and was kind of disappointed
omg the food was delicioso
there is nothing authentic about this place
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai
it s worth driving up from tucson
the selection was probably the worst ve seen in vegas there was none
pretty good beer selection too
this place is like chipotle but better
classy warm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak
stars for the brick oven bread app
have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left
he was terrible
everyone is treated equally special
it should n t take min for pancakes and eggs
it was delicious
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic real treat
sadly gordon ramsey s steak is place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious
best fish ve ever had in my life
the bathroom is just next door and very nice
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food have ever tasted
pretty cool would say
definitely turn off for me doubt ll be back unless someone else is buying
server did great job handling our large rowdy table
find wasting food to be despicable but this just was n t food
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm
would come back again if had sushi craving while in vegas
the staff are great the ambiance is great
he deserves stars
left with stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day
they dropped more than the ball
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable
they will customize your order any way you d like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best
best tacos in town by far
took back my money and got outta there
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing
rude inconsiderate management
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first minutes
wo n t be back
they have great dinners
the service was outshining definitely recommend the halibut
the food was terrible
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened
do n t recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving
will come back here every time m in vegas
this place deserves one star and has to do with the food
this is disgrace
def coming back to bowl next time
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place
will continue to come here on ladies night date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area
have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria
to summarize the food was incredible nay but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser
m probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it
kids pizza is always hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable
this one is simply disappointment
overall was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon
do n t have to be an accountant to know m getting screwed
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area
today was my first taste of gourmet hot dog and have to tell you it was more than ever thought possible
left very frustrated
ll definitely be in soon again
food was really good and got full petty fast
service was fantastic
total waste of time
do n t know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea
come hungry leave happy and stuffed
for service give them no stars
can assure you that you wo n t be disappointed
can take little bad service but the food sucks
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore
but now was completely grossed out
really enjoyed eating here
first time going but think will quickly become regular
our server was very nice and even though he looked little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end
from what my dinner companions told me everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste
on the ground right next to our table was large smeared been stepped in and tracked everywhere pile of green bird poop
furthermore you ca n t even find hours of operation on the website
we ve tried to like this place but after times think we re done with them
what mistake that was
no complaints
this is some seriously good pizza and m an expert on the topic
waiter was jerk
strike who wants to be rushed
these are the nicest restaurant owners ve ever come across
never come again
we loved the biscuits
service is quick and friendly
ordered an appetizer and took minutes and then the pizza another minutes
so fantastic
it was huge awkward piece of cow that was gristle and fat
definitely will come back here again
like steiners because it s dark and it feels like bar
wow very spicy but delicious
if you re not familiar check it out
ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere
d love to go back
anyway this fs restaurant has wonderful breakfast lunch
nothing special
each day of the week they have different deal and it s all so delicious
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is big winner
will not be back
sauce was tasteless
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor
do n t think we ll be going back anytime soon
food was so
am far from sushi connoisseur but can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food
was so insulted
the last times had lunch here has been bad
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat have ever eaten
the food was very good and enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc
think you are great
best tater tots in the southwest
we loved the place
definitely not worth the paid
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the choux pastry was fresh enough
im in az all the time and now have my new spot
the manager was the worst
the inside is really quite nice and very clean
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable
do n t think ll be running back to carly s anytime soon for food
this is was due to the fact that it took minutes to be acknowledged then another minutes to get our food and they kept forgetting things
love the margaritas too
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint
very good though
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading
great pork sandwich
do n t waste your time here
total letdown would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee
third the cheese on my friend s burger was cold
we enjoy their pizza and brunch
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked
we had group of when we claimed we would only have and they handled us beautifully
loved it
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they did n t bring that either
this place is jewel in las vegas and exactly what ve been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh
the selection of food was not the best
delicious and will absolutely be back
this is n t small family restaurant this is fine dining establishment
they had toro tartare with that was extraordinary and liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle
dont think will be back for very long time
it was attached to gas station and that is rarely good sign
how awesome is that
will be back many times soon
the menu had so much good stuff on it could not decide
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of me bunch of horrible name callings
conclusion very filling meals
their daily specials are always hit with my group
and then tragedy struck
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite
waitress was sweet and funny
also had to taste my mom s multi grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious
d rather eat airline food seriously
cant say enough good things about this place
the ambiance was incredible
the waitress and manager are so friendly
would not recommend this place
overall was n t very impressed with
my gyro was basically lettuce only
terrible service
thoroughly disappointed
do n t each much pasta but love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here
give it try you will be happy you did
by far the best we have ever had
reasonably priced also
everything was perfect the night we were in
the food is very good for your typical bar food
it was drive to get there
at first glance it is lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff
anyway do not think will go back there
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wo n t be disappointed
oh this is such thing of beauty this restaurant
if you have n t gone here go now
greasy unhealthy meal
first time there and might just be the last
those burgers were amazing
similarly the delivery man did not say word of apology when our food was minutes late
and it was way to expensive
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it to go the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for
this was my first time and ca n t wait until the next
the bartender was also nice
everything was good and tasty
this place is two thumbs up way up
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out sat or sun
if you love authentic mexican food and want whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place
terrible management
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman
if there were zero stars would give it zero stars
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts
worst martini ever
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc
had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh
wo n t try going back there even if it s empty
no m going to eat the potato that found some strangers hair in it
just spicy enough perfect actually
last night was my second time dining here and was so happy decided to go back
not even hello we will be right with you
the desserts were bit strange
my boyfriend and came here for the first time on recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service
really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place
nice ambiance
would recommend saving room for this
guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good
know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here
avoid this establishment
think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough
all of the tapas dishes were delicious
heart this place
my salad had bland on the baby greens and hearts of palm
after two felt disgusting
good time
believe that this place is great stop for those with huge belly and hankering for sushi
generous portions and great taste
will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped
food was delicious
an hour seriously
consider this theft
eew this location needs complete overhaul
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well
waited and waited and waited
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service
our server was super nice and checked on us many times
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not good way
swung in to give them try but was deeply disappointed
service was good and the company was better
the staff are also very friendly and efficient
as for the service m fan because it s quick and you re being served by some nice folks
boy was that sucker dry
over rated
if you look for authentic thai food go else where
their steaks are recommended
after pulled up my car waited for another minutes before being acknowledged
great food and great service in clean and friendly setting
all in all can assure you ll be back
hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives
my breakfast was great with beautiful presentation of giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar
the kids play area is nasty
great place fo take out or eat in
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan veggie options
omg felt like had never eaten thai food until this dish
it was extremely and pretty tasteless
it was pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus
got home to see the driest damn wings ever
it ll be regular stop on my trips to phoenix
really enjoyed crema caf before they expanded even told friends they had the best breakfast
not good for the money
miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting minutes just to place our order another minutes before the food arrived
they also have the best cheese crisp in town
good value great food great service
could n t ask for more satisfying meal
the food is good
it was awesome
just wanted to leave
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and was not one bit disappointed
will not be eating there again
the owners really really need to quit being cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one
checked out this place couple years ago and was not impressed
the chicken got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy
sorry will not be getting food from here anytime soon
an absolute must visit
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing
my friend did not like his bloody mary
despite how hard rate businesses its actually rare for me to give star
they really want to make your experience good one
will not return
had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland
very disappointing
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning
drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait
pretty awesome place
ambience is perfect
best of luck to the rude and non customer service focused new management
any grandmother can make roasted chicken better than this one
asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored went to the hostess and got one myself
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and baby
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good
same evening him and are both drastically sick
high quality chicken on the chicken caesar salad
ordered burger rare came in we ll done
we were promptly greeted and seated
tried to go here for lunch and it was madhouse
was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable
after waiting an hour and being seated was not in the greatest of moods
this is good joint
the here are insanely good
m not eating here
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative
maybe if they were n t cold they would have been somewhat edible
this place has lot of promise but fails to deliver
very bad experience
what mistake
food was average at best
great food
we wo n t be going back anytime soon
very very disappointed ordered the big bay plater
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer
it is perfect for sit down family meal or get together with few friends
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed
the patio seating was very comfortable
the fried rice was dry as well
hands down my favorite italian restaurant
that just screams legit in my book s also pretty rare here in vegas
it was just not fun experience
the atmosphere was great with lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested
personally love the hummus pita baklava and baba it s amazing what they do with eggplant
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous
both great
eclectic selection
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as have had
the staff was very attentive
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price
google mediocre and imagine will pop up
dont go here
promise they wo n t disappoint
as sushi lover avoid this place by all means
what great double cheeseburger
awesome service and food
fantastic neighborhood gem
ca n t wait to go back
the plantains were the worst ve ever tasted
it s great place and highly recommend it
service was slow and not attentive
gave it stars then and m giving it stars now
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me
dessert panna cotta was amazing
very good food great atmosphere
damn good steak
total brunch fail
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant
the steak was amazing rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate have ever had
good food good service
it was absolutely amazing
probably wo n t be back to be honest
will definitely be back
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with sauce is an excellent sandwich as well
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ve tried so far and they re all good
went for lunch service was slow
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed
was mortified
needless to say we will never be back here again
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible
was n t really impressed with strip steak
have been going since and every meal has been awesome
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me
work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer
the atmosphere here is fun
would not recommend to others
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it
mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it s so terrible
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased
not my thing
thumbs up
if you are reading this please do n t go there
loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough
they have really nice atmosphere
tonight had the elk filet special and it sucked
after one bite was hooked
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there few times and were sorely disappointed with everything
cute quaint simple honest
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside
the food was great as always compliments to the chef
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy
awesome selection of beer
great food and awesome service
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than or and they did n t expect more tip than that
fly was in my apple juice fly
the han nan chicken was also very tasty
as for the service thought it was good
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us
ryan s bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment wo n t be revisiting
nicest chinese restaurant ve been in while
overall like there food and the service
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world
probably never coming back and would n t recommend it
friend s pasta also bad he barely touched it
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service
love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper
never had anything to complain about here
the restaurant is very clean and has family restaurant feel to it
it was way over fried
m not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place
when opened the sandwich was impressed but not in good way
will not be back
there was warm feeling with the service and felt like their guest for special treat
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast
always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has wide array of options to choose from
have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
got to enjoy the seafood salad with fabulous
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth
level spicy was perfect where spice did n t over the soup
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic
main thing did n t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid and up
when m on this side of town this will definitely be spot ll hit up again
had to wait over minutes to get my drink and longer to get arepas
this is great place to eat
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good
the service was poor and thats being nice
food was good service was good prices were good
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather
but the service was beyond bad
m so happy to be here
tasted like dirt
one of the few places in phoenix that would definately go back to again
the block was amazing
it s close to my house it s low key non fancy affordable prices good food
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely stars
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless
great time family dinner on sunday night
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style
what did bother me was the slow service
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste
these were so good we ordered them twice
so in nutshell the smells like combination of dirty fish market and sewer
my girlfriend s veal was very bad
unfortunately it was not good
had pretty experience
join the club and get awesome offers via email
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder
bland and flavorless is good way of describing the barely tepid meat
the chains which m no fan of beat this place easily
the nachos are must have
we will not be coming back
do n t have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff
great atmosphere friendly and fast service
when received my pita it was huge it did have lot of meat in it so thumbs up there
once your food arrives it s meh
paying for hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of kid s meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of good meal
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too
so good am going to have to review this place twice once tribute to the place and once as tribute to an event held here last night
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh
this place is great
mediocre food
once you get inside you ll be impressed with the place
m super
and service was super friendly
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked
this place was such nice surprise
they were golden crispy and delicious
had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat
could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine
not single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed water refill once they finally served us our food
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered
the first time ever came here had an amazing experience still tell people how awesome the duck was
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome would not suggest this place
the service was terrible though
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced
it was packed
love this place
can say that the desserts were yummy
the food was terrible
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree
it kept getting worse and worse so now m officially done
this place should honestly be blown up
but definitely would not eat here again
do not waste your money here
love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes
the cr pe was delicate and thin and moist
awful service
wo n t ever go here again
food quality has been horrible
for that price can think of few place would have much rather gone
the service here is fair at best
do love sushi but found kabuki to be over priced over hip and under services
do yourself favor and stay away from this dish
very poor service
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day
they were excellent
paid the bill but did not tip because felt the server did terrible job
just had lunch here and had great experience
have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small
recently tried caballero s and have been back every week since
for bucks head really expect better food
the food came out at good pace
ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad
wo n t be back
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were
this place deserves no stars
would not recommend this place
in fact m going to round up to stars just because she was so awesome
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods have ever tasted
bad day or not have very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit
probably would not go here again
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat
the price is reasonable and the service is great
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they did n t look too appealing
went in for happy hour great list of wines
some may say this buffet is pricey but think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite lot
probably wo n t be coming back here
worst food service ve had in while
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant
talk about great customer service of course we will be back
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room temp watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloves everything is deep fried in oil
love their fries and their beans
always pleasure dealing with him
they have plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ve tried gets my seal of approval
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best
started this review with two stars but m editing it to give it only one
this is the worst sushi have ever eat besides costco s
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service unique menu and beautiful setting
my boyfriend and sat at the bar and had completely delightful experience
weird vibe from owners
there was hardly any meat
ve had better bagels from the grocery store
go to place for gyros
love the owner chef his one authentic japanese cool dude
now the burgers are n t as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless
found six inch long piece of wire in my salsa
the service was terrible food was mediocre
we definately enjoyed ourselves
ordered soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs
on three different occasions asked for well done or medium well and all three times got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
had about two bites and refused to eat anymore
the service was extremely slow
after minutes wait got table
seriously killer hot chai latte
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love
their rotating beers on tap is also highlight of this place
pricing is bit of concern at mellow mushroom
worst thai ever
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once
want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service
the pizza selections are good
had strawberry tea which was good
highly unprofessional and rude to loyal patron
overall great experience
spend your money elsewhere
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm
the buffet at bellagio was far from what anticipated
and the drinks are weak people
my order was not correct
also feel like the chips are bought not made in house
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert
the chips and sals here is amazing
we wo n t be returning
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot
seriously can not believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off
very very sad
felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that
how can you call yourself steakhouse if you ca n t properly cook steak do n t understand
m not impressed with the concept or the food
the only thing was n t too crazy about was their guacamole as do n t like it pur ed
there is really nothing for me at hope your experience is better
got food poisoning here at the buffet
they brought fresh batch of fries and was thinking yay something warm but no
what should have been hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us
needless to say wo n t be going back anytime soon
this place is disgusting
every time eat here see caring teamwork to professional degree
the ri style calamari was joke
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible
could barely stomach the meal but did n t complain because it was business lunch
it was so bad had lost the heart to finish it
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it
we are n t ones to make scene at restaurants but just do n t get it definitely lost the love after this one
disappointing experience
the food is about on par with denny s which is to say not good at all
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you
over rated is all am saying
we wo n t be going back
the place was fairly clean but the food simply was n t worth it
this place lacked style
the sangria was about half of glass wine full and was ridiculous
do n t bother coming here
the meat was pretty dry had the sliced brisket and pulled pork
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but would n t eat here again
it was equally awful
probably not in hurry to go back
very slow at seating even with reservation
not good by any stretch of the imagination
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked
the ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat
it was bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
was very disappointed
this place is horrible and way overpriced
maybe it s just their vegetarian fare but ve been twice and thought it was average at best
it was n t busy at all and now we know why
the tables outside are also dirty lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
the ambiance here did not feel like buffet setting but more of indoor garden for tea and biscuits
con spotty service
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger
but then they came back cold
then our food came out disappointment ensued
the real disappointment was our waiter
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach
insults profound and had to go outside for smoke break while serving just to solidify it
if someone orders two tacos do n t you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door
after all the rave reviews could n t wait to eat here what disappointment
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
it s not hard to make decent hamburger
but do n t like it
hell no will go back
we ve have gotten much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant
do n t know what the big deal is about this place but wo n t be back ya all
immediately said wanted to talk to the manager but did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar
the ambiance is n t much better
unfortunately it only set us up for with our entrees
the food was n t good
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked
what happened next was pretty off putting
too bad cause know it s family owned really wanted to like this place
overpriced for what you are getting
vomited in the bathroom mid lunch
kept looking at the time and it had soon become minutes yet still no food
have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would ever return to and this tops the list
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously was n t fresh
food was below average
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but would expect little bit more coming from restaurant
all in all ha long bay was bit of flop
the problem have is that they charge for sandwich that is no bigger than subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables
shrimp when unwrapped it live only mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry
it really is impressive that the place has n t closed down
would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland
spend your money and time some place else
lady at the table next to us found live green caterpillar in her salad
the presentation of the food was awful
ca n t tell you how disappointed was
think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
appetite instantly gone
overall was not impressed and would not go back
the whole experience was underwhelming and think we ll just go to ninja sushi next time
then as if had n t wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
