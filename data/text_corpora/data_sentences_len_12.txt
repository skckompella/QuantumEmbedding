good case excellent value
great for the jawbone
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than minutes major problems
the mic is great
if you are razr owner you must have this
needless to say wasted my money
what waste of money and time
and the sound quality is great
very good quality though
highly recommend for any one who has blue tooth phone

bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it
the commercials are the most misleading

this is simple little phone to use but the breakage is
it is unusable in moving car at freeway speed

this phone works great
the construction of the headsets is poor

the ear buds only play music in one ear
dont waste your money

if you plan to use this in car forget about it
found this product to be too big

integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
definitely bargain
this for the car charger and it does not work
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful
great product fast shipping

it is very comfortable on the ear
it has been winner for us
setup could n t have been simpler
could not get strong enough signal
iam very pleased with my purchase
bad quality

great audio
basically the service was very bad
ve only had my bluetooth for few weeks but really like it
the bt headset was such
the accompanied software is almost brilliant

buyer be very careful
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed
very good stuff for the price
my headset works just peachy keen
voice recognition is tremendous
what waste
was not happy with this item
very disappointed
the phone takes forever to charge like to hours literally
got this phone on from relative and m glad did
what waste of time
its reception is very very poor
items stated as included from the description are not included
after months screen just went black all of sudden
was hoping for more
audio quality is poor very poor
had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my blackberry curve
ve bought wired headphones that sound better than these
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there
this item is fantastic and works perfectly
and just love the colors
is just superb
great charger
this is essentially communications tool that does not communicate
great value
does n t last long
one thing hate is the mode set button at the side
excellent service
thank you for wasting my money
how can that be the audio quality is poor
the igo chargers and tips are really great
superb phone on great network
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device
do n t buy this product
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome
incredible
design flaw
great phone
waste of bucks
the replacement died in few weeks
any ring tone overall good phone to buy
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone
have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more
not impressed
light weight hardly notice it is there
you ll love how thin it is
bad choice
the pleather case does n t fit
useless phone simply deaf
all in all think it was good investment
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters
battery lasts only few hours
great headset very impressed
the mega pixel camera being part of phone is reasonably
good transmit audio
we are sending it back
if you hate avoid this phone by all means
great price also
fast service

best bluetooth on the market
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort recommend you this case

big disappointment with calendar sync
the phone was unusable and was not new
worst customer service ever
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever
it defeats the purpose of bluetooth headset
worth every penny
excellent wallet type phone case
nice headphones for the price and they work great
internet is slow
it s fits like glove and is strong secure and durable
my gosh the best phone have ever had
it s very attractive and appears to be of good quality

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor
sending it back
now know that made wise decision
someone invented this sooner
good price
received it quickly and it works great
has been working great
as many people complained found this headset s microphone was very weak
my old nokia from tracfone holds the charge lot better than this
they do not care about the consumer one bit
this is good battery and it got here really fast
the instruction manual is lacking
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena
we have gotten lot of compliments on it
want my money back
love this device
am also very happy with the price
ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately
the is still lacking in earbuds
was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem
good item low price
however the are not the best and neither are the games
the plug did not work very well
amazon sucks
rip off over charge shipping
very comfortable
the reception is excellent
obviously there is problem with the adhesive
very disappointing
it was an inexpensive piece but would still have expected better quality
excellent sound quality
was not happy
piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for days
new battery works great in phone
worst customer service
reception is terrible and full of static
good audio quality

comfortable nice range good battery life
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible
excellent starter wireless headset
first off the reception sucks have never had more than bars ever
the phone gets extremely hot
nice design and quality
bad fit way too big
it definitely was not as good as my
awesome device
waste of money
had ordered motorola data cable got very well finished and working product

every thing on phone work perfectly she like it
it s really easy
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect
fantastic earphones
it finds my cell phone right away when enter the car
low quality
highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone
warning stay away
wish could return the unit and get back my money
device works great
very displeased
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
restored my phone to like new performance
searched the internet and found this one to be the best value
does not fit
very happy with this product
there s really nothing bad can say about this headset
portable and it works
my colleague now get great reception little expensive but performance is great
not good when wearing hat or sunglasses
timely shipment and quality product
nice solid keyboard
very well made and fits my surefire perfectly
horrible phone
battery junk
we would recommend these to others
cant get the software to work with my computer
disappointed
poor voice clarity
the battery works great
no buyers remorse on this one
very disappointed in
looks great and is strong
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
disappointment hate anything that goes in my ear
great software for
the delivery was on time
very easy to use
uncomfortable in the ear do n t use with lg env
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to destination unknown
d like to return it
after charging overnight these batteries work great
you wo n t regret it
love this phone
disappointment
its not user friendly
then exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
this pda rocks
had verizon years ago and really liked their service
pretty piece of junk
plug was the wrong size
works as described
save your money ve had this item for months now
bad purchase
well im satisfied
this battery is an excellent bargain
defective crap
would have given no star if was able
wear glasses and it fits fine with them
would not recommend this item to anyone
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
great no problems at all
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching
very good product well made
mobile phone tools are must have
the phone is sturdy and waterproof
thanks again to amazon for having the things need for good price
works great
really ugly
horrible had to switch times
the noise shield is
no real improvement
razr battery good buy
keep up the good work amazon
they refuse to refund or replace
so basically threw my money out the window for nothing
great case and price
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly
am glad purchased it
ve missed numerous calls because of this reason
do n t buy this product
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
worst software ever used if could give this zero stars would
trying to make call on these is an exercise in frustration
love the camera it s really pretty good quality
thank you for such great service
its total package
give star will contact cingular at and inform them of this practice
it s aggravating
great product for the price
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone
none of it works just do n t buy it
please dont waste your money
all in all m quite satisfied with this purchase
yet continues to use the same flawed charger design
results
cumbersome design
great product
it s piece of crap
this fixes all the problems
worst ever
am very happy
can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what
the battery life is highly unacceptable
that company is joke
it does everything the description said it would
voice quality signal strength dropped calls
better than expected
battery is holding up well
also difficult to put on d recommend avoiding this product
sprint terrible customer service
linked to my phone without effort
they are so cool
easy to use
better than new
what me to get this junk have no idea
piece of trash
pretty good product
this is great phone
their research and development division obviously knows what they re doing
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
those phones are working just fine now
am more than happy with this product
poor construction
this is infuriating
overall would recommend this phone over the new walkman
sprint charges for this service
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on
it does n t work in europe or asia
poor product
however needed some better instructions
do not buy do not sucks
this is great product sure beats using your fingers
plus seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
very performance
recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell players in the family
do n t bother go to the store
you get what you pay for guess
these are fabulous
disappointing accessory from good manufacturer
very wind resistant
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are
great phone
m pleased
battery is terrible
found the product to be easy to set up and use
utter crap sound quality is terrible
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work
no ear loop needed it s tiny and the sound is great
talk about useless customer service
it felt too light and tinny
m happy about this purchase good quality and low price
love the look and feel of samsung
its well designed and very sharp the blue is very nice color
does everything it should and more
could not recommend these more
nice sound
looks good in the picture but this case was huge disappointment
much less than the jawbone was going to replace it with
setup went very smoothly
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it
must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
then had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
ca n t upload ringtones from third party
truly awful
and none of the tones is acceptable
camera color balance is awful
love the ringtones because they are so upbeat
chinese forgeries abound
easy to pair with my samsung cell
the instructions did n t explain that microphone jack could be used
would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
too bad you have to pay up to month for the service
works well
the nokia usb cable did not work with my phone
clear crisp sound
the biggest complaint have is the battery drains superfast
do not buy if you want to use the holster
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips
it does n t make you look cool
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all
you ca n t beat the price on these
lightweight and works well
so just beware
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation
ca n t store anything but phone numbers to sim
poor quality
jabra ear gels the best
not worth it
the phone crashed completely and now have to get it replaced
it was great phone
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality
it has everything need and could n t ask for more
after receiving and using the product for just days it broke
t mobile has the best customer service anywhere
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold
we have tried units and they both failed within months pros
provides good protection and looks classy too
always good
the is user friendly and makes it easy etc
the design is very good
great reception all the time
would highly recommend this product
could n t use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
stay away from this store be careful
this hands free phone speaker is awesome
does not fit
disappointing
blue ant is easy to use
the nano stated it my son was dissapointed
the sound quality is excellent as well
its the best headset have used
would not
just what wanted
this particular model would not work with my motorola smartphone
wont work right or atleast for me
great product
crisp and clear
after the first charge kept going dead after minutes
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor
the reception has been generally good
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot
great bluetooth
highly recommend this case
worthwhile
this is great deal
am sorry made this purchase
it was horrible
do n t think it would hold it too on your belt
they work about weeks then break
it is simple to use and like it
ca n t use this case because the smell is disgusting
not what wanted
own of these cases and would order another
great phone
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
perfect for the
five star plus plus
down the drain
good works fine
for the price this was great deal
great price too
if there is wind it is completely useless
yes it s shiny on front side and love it
does not work
the reception through this headset is excellent
thumbs up to this seller
improper description had to return it
it works it is comfortable
battery charge life is quite long
the jabra fit my ears very well
battery has no life
product is exactly as described
gets signal when other verizon phones wo n t
does n t do the job
would recommend it
plan on ordering from them again and again
have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one
awkward to use and unreliable
the shipping time was also very quick
not as good as had hoped
good case
does n t work
really good product
unfortunately it did not work
all three broke within two months of use
dont buy it
my father has the and the battery is dying
horrible horrible protector
do n t like this nokia either
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone
terrible my car will not accept this cassette
it s not what it says it is
stay away from the
used and dirty
very unreliable service from t mobile
not good enough for the price
bought two of them and neither will charge
it looks very nice
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
comfortable in my hand
just does not work
poor reliability
it works
terrible product and waste of money
last time buying from you
it was waste of my money
so far it has worked like charm
have only had it for few weeks but so far so good
would recommend this item
nice case feels good in your hands
the item received was counterfeit
works fine
received my headset in good time and was happy with it
my sister has one also and she loves it
good quality
this is by far the worst purchase ve made on amazon
excellent dual purpose headset
excellent
does not work for listening to music with the cingular
the line another worthless cheap gimmick from sprint
having trouble with volume
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears
warning do not buy
best headset ever
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips
excellent product for the price
bad reception
this product is very high quality chinese crap
it was quite comfortable in the ear
great phone
do n t buy this product it fails
everything about this product is wrong first
terrible phone holder
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look
how stupid is that
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors
good show samsung
so bought about of these and saved alot of money
could n t figure it out
leopard print is wonderfully wild
works for me
saggy floppy piece of junk
much better than the hard plastic cases
it also had new problem
happy so far
cool phone
works good
motorola finally got the voice quality of bluetooth headset right
but it is great would really recommend it
as said above pretty useless
never got it
down the drain because of weak snap
does not charge the cingular att phone
the headset fulfills my requirements so am happy with my purchase
logitech bluetooth headset is
the mic there is joke and the volume is quite low
m returning them
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound
nice leather
had to purchase different case
it is joy to use
very much disappointed with this company
very satisifed with that
it did n t charge for me
buttons are too small
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow
love it great armband
however the keypads are so tinny that sometimes reach the wrong buttons
was very impressed with the price of the cases
also makes it easier to hold on to
it s pretty easy
can not make calls at certain places
beautiful styling though
m trying to return it for refund
plugged it in only to find out not darn thing worked
excellent product
earbud piece breaks easily
lousy product
it is the best charger have seen on the market yet
sweetest phone
oh the charger seems to work fine
not enough volume
echo problem very unsatisfactory
do n t waste your money
adapter does not provide enough charging current
phone falls out easily
it did n t work people can not hear me when talk
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use
painful on the ear
lasted one day and then blew up
disappointed
kind of flops around
what piece of junk lose more calls on this phone
item does not match picture
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
very very very slow moving aimless movie about distressed drifting young man
very little music or anything to speak of
wasted two hours
bit predictable
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher
and those baby owls were adorable
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious
it was so cool
it s quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable
this short film certainly pulls no punches
graphics is far from the best part of the game
this is the number one best th game in the series
it deserves strong love
it is an insane game
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it s just massive game
waste your money on this game
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly
actually the graphics were good at the time
today the graphics are crap
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye
this game rocks
buy it play it enjoy it love it
it s pure brilliance
this was flick doomed from its conception
was n t the least bit interested
but it s just not funny
but even the talented carrell ca n t save this
the story itself is just predictable and lazy
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget
long whiny and pointless
but recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go
excellent cast story line performances
totally believable
anne heche was utterly convincing
sam shepard s portrayal of gung ho marine was sobering
sat riveted to the tv screen
all in all give this one resounding out of
do think tom hanks is good actor
enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little
was very disappointed in the movie
there is totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters
this movie totally grates on my nerves
and quite honestly often its not very good
there are some generally great things in it
would n t say they re worth hours of your time though
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from to pg
alexander nevsky is great film
this if the first movie ve given to in years
overall the film is interesting and thought provoking
plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time
give this one look
gave it
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted
it is true classic
definitely worth checking out
the problem was the script
it was horrendous
there was nothing believable about it at all
the cast of veteran actors are more than just nostalgia trip
do n t think you will be disappointed
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere
it was too predictable even for chick flick
too politically correct
very disappointing
love lane but ve never seen her in movie this lousy
an hour and half wish could bring back
but in terms of the writing it s very fresh and bold
the directing and the cinematography are n t quite as good
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that had to look away
the directing seems too pretentious
the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are misplace
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode
some applause should be given to the prelude however
really liked that
great film by great director
the music in the film is really nice too
d advise anyone to go and see it
brilliant
liked this movie way too much
this was poor remake of my best friends wedding
all in all great disappointment
can not believe that the actors agreed to do this film
saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience
this is definitely cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others
truly truly bad film
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse
paid too much
also it s real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse
it was so boring
no plot whatsoever
again no plot at all
horrible
worst hour and half of my life oh my gosh
hate movies like that
yeah the movie pretty much sucked
there is no plot or storyline
awful
certainly do not mean this distinction in good way
mean this in terrible way
this film has no redeeming features
everything is appalling
artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i
the story is beyond stupid
the script is was there script
the kids are annoying
the lead man is charisma free
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture
ll even say it again this is torture
maybe there would be reasonable explanation for this atrocity
not pleasant voyage of self discovery
highly
if this premise sound stupid that s because it is
yes it s that bad
nothing at all to recommend
an excellent performance from ms
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense
there were too many close ups
but this movie is definitely below average rent
you ll love it
this movie is bad
so bad
the film is way too long
this is definitely one of the bad ones
the movie received was great quality film for it s age
think that it is must see older john wayne film
really do n t see how anyone could enjoy this movie
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles
his performance is simply genius
ray charles is legendary
hitchcock is great director
ironically mostly find his films total waste of time to watch
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie
hence the whole story lacks certain energy
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws
mishima is extremely uninteresting
schrader has made resume full of lousy amateurish films
when first watched this movie in the loved it
was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything
the character developments also lacked in depth
woa talk about awful
do not waste your time
it was just too horrible
the worst dialogue could go on and on
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction
the poor actors
this would not even be good as made for tv flick
regrettably the film fails
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie
yet enjoy watching it
unfortunately this is bad movie that is just plain bad
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad
the dialogue sucked
the cinematography if it can be called that sucked
the soundtrack sucked
the acting sucked
the concert sequences just sucked
that was nice
that was funny
it was so funny
overall this movie was cheap trash
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it
came out of it feeling angry
all things considered job very well done
thanks good movie like this was done and released
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film
up there with the best of melville
everything about this film is simply incredible
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of child
m not sure what he was trying to do with this film
there is lot of beautiful places
it was forced like everything in this movie
again lame
here s where the movie really pi ed me off
and do n t even get me started on the jerky camerawork
when saw it in the theater thought was going to be sick
summary the witticisms were n t witty
the plot well said d let that one go
the acting was bad
really bad
camerawork again bad
rating out of
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me
three of the most visually appealing movies ve ever seen
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome
recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything work of art
out of for both the movie and trilogy
literally vomited while watching this film
his performance as awarded was stunning
in most wonderful location lies story of contrast
this is such fun and funny movie
highly entertaining at all angles
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts
it even has its sweet moments
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played
and really did find them funny
this is actually very smart movie
there is brilliant twist ending
love it
the ending is so so perfect you ll shed tear
am so thrilled after seeing movie like this
will never forget it now
it is not just cult it is cult classic
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue
this movie is terrible
to call this movie drama is ridiculous
glad did n t pay to see it
did n t laugh or even smile once
but it was n t anything at all just one big yawn
it is really good show to watch
it is very educational for children to years old
barney is definitely super de duper
is pretty funny
bop is very cute
the kids are very cool too
it s just lame
everything about this movie is stupid
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie
it is shameful
would give this television series plus if could
now you know why gave it
everything from acting to cinematography was solid
definitely worth checking out
this movie has cutting edge to it
felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever
the jerky camera movements were also annoying
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror
this was such an awesome movie that bought it off of ebay
god and can never get that minutes back
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer
this is high adventure at its best
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful
good commentary of today s love and undoubtedly film worth seeing
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents
rather enjoyed it
liked it
could n t take them seriously
it really created unique feeling though
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script
world better than of the garbage in the theatres today
her role was played well
not too not to masculine but just right
the camera really likes her in this movie
would have casted her in that role after ready the script
am fan of his this movie sucked really bad
even worse than ticker
that movie was bad
only like or buildings used couple of locations maybe poor
it just blew
wish could enter negative values admins
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too
and only because there is no setting for
the soundtrack was n t terrible either
both do good jobs and are quite amusing
the last minutes of movie are also not bad as well
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than period universal movie
believe the screenwriter did good job of tying up the loose ends
my score is mostly for the plot
wow what bad film
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible
not even good for camp value
was n t expecting oscar material but this
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative
this gets out of simply because there s nothing lower
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving
the only thing worse than taylor s acting was stanwyck s singing
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely
was deeply impressed with the character he played
even the squibs look awful
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense
the directing is sloppy at best
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing
of course the acting is blah
overall rate this movie out of scale
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way
but this movie really got to me
see it
this movie is good and humorous comment on life in
found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting
later found myself lost in the power of the film
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film
duris has wholesome appearance and gives fine performance
the rest of the cast also play well
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers
about ten minutes into this film started having second thoughts
about half way through this film started to dislike it
by the time the film ended not only disliked it despised it
what this film lacks is convincing script
the cast is good
for that it s worth checking out
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show have ever seen
everything about it is just bad
final word this show is real torture
it is zillion times away from reality
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical
whatever prompted such documentary is beyond me
very serious spoilers this movie was huge disappointment
there are so many problems dont know where to start
the cast was great
but the movie makes lot of serious mistakes
there is no real plot
wouldnt see this movie again for free
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history
the original body and soul is masterpiece
do n t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake
this may be the only bad film he ever made
so bad well it s just bad
thought it was bad
the script is big flawed mess
the movie is terribly boring in places
the lighting is awful
the film looks cheap and bland
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore
the visual effects were awful
got ta love those close ups of slimy drooling teeth
not recommended
the budget was evidently very limited
was less expansive
generally it just lacked imagination
not recommended
is it possible for movie to get any worse than this
beware this is not trashy cult movie this is trash period
ca n t believe there s even sequel to this
which is precisely why am giving it such bad review
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called lead
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done
saw this movie and thought this is stupid movie
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish
the story line is just awful
it s just painful
and the accents are absolutely abysmal
there s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit
do n t waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film
believe that pitch black was done well
go watch it
omit watching this
very funny
my rating just out of
the characters are interesting and you really care for them
do n t miss it
regardless the film fails on most levels
avoid at all costs
saw this film over christmas and what great film it was
ll give this film out of
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master s stable
excellently produced by one of sci fi s best producers scot vandiver
but it is entertaining nonetheless
it s campy sort of film that s joy to watch
the cast is always entertaining as usual
overall delight
the least said about the acting the better
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film
do n t be afraid of subtitles its worth little aversion therapy
excellent performance
there still are good actors around
also great directing and photography
very true to shakespear and must for all shakespear fans
it is not good
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and
then the film just dropped the ball
this is stunning movie
raw and sublimely moving
all of the main players are mesmerising
julian fellowes has triumphed again
he s national treasure
go and see it
this is an excellent film
the aerial scenes were well done
it was also the right balance of war and love
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes difference
good film by great director
this is just great movie
out of stars
punishment park is brilliant piece of cinema
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films
advise you to look out for it
you wont regret it
highly recommended a
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is
it s mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage
it s case of so bad it is laughable
it is film about nothing just pretext to show ridiculous action scenes
how awful she is
the results well are shame
delete this film from your mind
one of the worst shows of all time
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors
lame would be the best way to describe it
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong
you can find better movies at youtube
lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever
that s how d describe this painfully dreary time waster of film
it s an empty hollow shell of movie
avoid avoid avoid
it will drive you barking mad
the transfers are very good
very nice and relaxing late night viewing
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title
some great music and terrific scenery
happy wonderful feel good ending
nothing new there
that was done in the second movie
what on earth is irons doing in this film
just saw this film and recommend it
very good film indeed about great and unconditional love
despite the pans of reviewers liked this movie
guess liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable
the football scenes at the end were perplexing
but thought his acting was skilled
meredith was better than all right
very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart
nine out of ten for truly lovely film
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early s
standout scene
this scene is very strong and unpleasant
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end
this movie is also revealing
and it was boring
it s fresh subtle and rather sublime effect
an italian reviewer called this small great film and that s right
you wo n t forget this movie
why was this film made
the film has an ultra cheap look to it
the result is film that just do n t look right
none of them are engaging or exciting
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time
this movie is so awesome
loved it it was really scary
if you want real scare rent this one
this is an extraordinary film
predictable but not bad watch
she carries the movie well
in fact this stinker smells like direct to video release
avoid at all costs
star trek the final frontier is the worst in the series
the only place good for this film is in the garbage
the worst one of the series
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way
this film offers many delights and surprises
but this understated film leaves lasting impression
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop
the acting as you d expect from this cast is top notch
conclusion loved it
it s long time since was so entertained by movie
struggle to find anything bad to say about it
trumbull on love lucy
see both films if you can
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist
it s very slow
do n t waste your time
this was one of the worst films have ever seen
m still trying to get over how bad it was
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle
lots of holes in the script
it s like bad two hour tv movie
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong
the dialogue is atrocious
the acting is beyond abysmal
everything stinks
it s dumb and pointless and complete waste of time
in short do n t bother with this movie
wo n t spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing
film not easily forgotten
the characters are interesting even if bit predictable
great movie
also the story and acting were weak
either way it sucks
the script is horrendously stupid
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid
what the hell kind of crap is that
then there s the plot holes
you could drive semi truck into these holes
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film
she s poised and amazing
dee snider just plain sucks
was bored throughout the whole damn thing
piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid
avoid at any and all costs
avoid this film at all costs
do n t know what happened in season five what mess
now this is movie really dislike
the best part about nurse betty is it s unpredictability
otherwise do n t even waste your time on this
this one just fails to create any real suspense
m so sorry but really ca n t recommend it to anyone
one of the most boring pointless movies have ever seen
hated it
highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
this is not movie making
excellent short film
agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad
the story line is totally predictable
ve seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie
bad characters bad story and bad acting
really awful
not easy to watch
funny clever hip just like pray s previous film hype
rate this movie
this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful
the story is also both funny and poignant at times
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie
go rent it
brilliance indeed
think of the film being like dream
simply beautiful
the movie seemed little slow at first
but it picked up speed and got right to the point
enjoyed it
have recommended it to friends
was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz
their on screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine
the film s dialogue is natural real to life
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film
instead we got bore fest about whiny spoiled brat babysitting
it is very well acted and done tv movie
keep watching it over and over
it s sad movie but very good
if you have not seen this movie definitely recommend it
she is as lovely as usual this cutie
still it s quite interesting and entertaining to follow
recommend with confidence
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were hoot
fans of the genre will be in heaven
lange had become great actress
it looked like wonderful story
never walked out of movie faster
just got bored watching lange take her clothes off
in word it is embarrassing
exceptionally bad
wow loved this place
crust is not good
not tasty and the texture was just nasty
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices
now am getting angry and want my damn pho
it did n t taste that fresh
the fries were great too
great touch
service was very prompt
would not go back
tried the cape cod chicken with cranberry mmmm
was disgusted because was pretty sure that was human hair
was shocked because no signs indicate cash only
highly recommended
waitress was little slow in service
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas
did not like at all
the blah
the food amazing
service is also cute
could care less the interior is just beautiful
so they performed
they never brought salad we asked for
the worst was the salmon sashimi
this was like the final blow
found this place by accident and could not be happier
overall like this place lot
ample portions and good prices
my first visit to hiro was delight
service sucks
the shrimp tender and moist
on positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service
the only thing did like was the prime rib and dessert section
it s too bad the food is so damn generic
the burger is good beef cooked just right
if you want sandwich just go to any firehouse
their chow mein is so good
the portion was huge
loved it friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu
not much seafood and like strings of pasta at the bottom
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless
this place receives stars for their appetizers
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious
we d definitely go back here again
we are so glad we found this place
great food and service huge portions and they give military discount
always great time at dos gringos
great way to finish great
really really good rice all the time
the service was meh
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well
times very bad customer service
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well
the turkey and roast beef were bland
this place has it
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying
all have to say is the food was amazing
omelets are to die for
everything was fresh and delicious
in summary this was largely disappointing dining experience
best breakfast buffet
say bye bye to your tip lady
we ll never go again
will be back again
food arrived quickly
it was not good
on the up side their cafe serves really good food
best buffet in town for the price you can not beat it
this is one of the better buffets that have been to
so we went to and had fantastic afternoon
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing
will go back next trip out
sooooo good
real sushi lovers let s be honest yama is not that good
this is really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth visit
nice spicy and tender
good prices
check it out
it was pretty gross
ve had better atmosphere
kind of hard to mess up steak but they did
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries
service was fine and the waitress was friendly
host staff were for lack of better word bitches
phenomenal food service and ambiance
would n t return
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food
penne vodka excellent
the management is rude
had seriously solid breakfast here
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas
do n t do it
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated
give it thumbs down
this is great restaurant at the mandalay bay
we waited for forty five minutes in vain
crostini that came with the salad was stale
some highlights great quality nigiri here
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean
this place is good
came back today since they relocated and still not impressed
was seated immediately
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced
avoid at all cost
restaurant is always full but never wait
delicious
ve never been treated so bad
bacon is hella salty
the waitresses are very friendly
the service here leaves lot to be desired
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining touch of coziness
dressed up to be treated so rudely
it was probably dirt
ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible
interesting decor
what really like there is the crepe station
you can watch them preparing the delicious food
both of the egg rolls were fantastic
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing
the best place to go for tasty bowl of pho
the live music on fridays totally blows
ve never been more insulted or felt disrespected
very friendly staff
it is worth the drive
food was great and so was the
the warm beer did n t help
great brunch spot
service is friendly and inviting
very good lunch spot
the worst experience ever
must have been an off night at this place
the sides are mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn
my friend loved the salmon tartar
wo n t go back
extremely tasty
waitress was good though
soggy and not good
the jamaican mojitos are delicious
which are small and not worth the price
the food is rich so order accordingly
the service was bit lacking
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad
loved the bacon wrapped dates
this is an unbelievable bargain
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special
as for the mains also uninspired
this is the place where first had pho and it was amazing
very very fun chef
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service
horrible do n t waste your time and money
now this dish was quite
it was n t busy either also the building was freezing cold
drinks took close to minutes to come out at one point
seriously flavorful delights folks
much better than the other sushi place went to in vegas
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood
owner s are really great people
there is nothing privileged about working eating there
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty
we had at our table and the service was pretty fast
fantastic service here
as well would ve given godfathers zero stars if possible
they know how to make them here
very tough and very short on flavor
hope this place sticks around
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion
plus it s only bucks
the service was not up to par either
just as good as when had it more than year ago
for self proclaimed coffee cafe was wildly disappointed
the platter is out of this world
you cant go wrong with any of the food here
you ca n t beat that
the chefs were friendly and did good job
liked the patio and the service was outstanding
think not again
went to bachi burger on friend s recommendation and was not disappointed
service stinks here
waited and waited
this place is not quality sushi it is not quality restaurant
would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza
great pizza and salads
things that went wrong they burned the
this place is amazing
just do n t know why they were so slow
did n t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care
love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it
never again will be dining at this place
the food was excellent and service was very good
good beer drink selection and good food selection
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles
food was really boring
good service check
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me
will never ever go back
did not expect this to be so good
fantastic food
she ordered toasted english muffin that came out untoasted
the food was very good
never going back
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude
all the bread is made in house
the only downside is the service
also the fries are without doubt the worst fries ve ever had
service was exceptional and food was good as all the reviews
couple of months later returned and had an amazing meal
favorite place in town for
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal
you wo n t be disappointed
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere
everything was gross
love this place
great service and food
the burger got the gold standard burger and was kind of disappointed
omg the food was delicioso
there is nothing authentic about this place
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai
it s worth driving up from tucson
pretty good beer selection too
this place is like chipotle but better
classy warm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak
stars for the brick oven bread app
have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left
he was terrible
everyone is treated equally special
it should n t take min for pancakes and eggs
it was delicious
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious
best fish ve ever had in my life
the bathroom is just next door and very nice
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland
pretty cool would say
server did great job handling our large rowdy table
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm
would come back again if had sushi craving while in vegas
the staff are great the ambiance is great
he deserves stars
left with stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day
they dropped more than the ball
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best
best tacos in town by far
took back my money and got outta there
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing
rude inconsiderate management
wo n t be back
they have great dinners
the service was outshining definitely recommend the halibut
the food was terrible
will come back here every time m in vegas
this place deserves one star and has to do with the food
this is disgrace
def coming back to bowl next time
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable
this one is simply disappointment
overall was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon
left very frustrated
ll definitely be in soon again
food was really good and got full petty fast
service was fantastic
total waste of time
come hungry leave happy and stuffed
for service give them no stars
can assure you that you wo n t be disappointed
can take little bad service but the food sucks
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore
but now was completely grossed out
really enjoyed eating here
first time going but think will quickly become regular
what mistake that was
no complaints
waiter was jerk
strike who wants to be rushed
these are the nicest restaurant owners ve ever come across
never come again
we loved the biscuits
service is quick and friendly
ordered an appetizer and took minutes and then the pizza another minutes
so fantastic
it was huge awkward piece of cow that was gristle and fat
definitely will come back here again
like steiners because it s dark and it feels like bar
wow very spicy but delicious
if you re not familiar check it out
ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere
d love to go back
anyway this fs restaurant has wonderful breakfast lunch
nothing special
will not be back
sauce was tasteless
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor
do n t think we ll be going back anytime soon
food was so
was so insulted
the last times had lunch here has been bad
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat have ever eaten
think you are great
best tater tots in the southwest
we loved the place
definitely not worth the paid
im in az all the time and now have my new spot
the manager was the worst
the inside is really quite nice and very clean
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable
love the margaritas too
very good though
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading
great pork sandwich
do n t waste your time here
third the cheese on my friend s burger was cold
we enjoy their pizza and brunch
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked
loved it
the selection of food was not the best
delicious and will absolutely be back
this is n t small family restaurant this is fine dining establishment
dont think will be back for very long time
it was attached to gas station and that is rarely good sign
how awesome is that
will be back many times soon
the menu had so much good stuff on it could not decide
conclusion very filling meals
their daily specials are always hit with my group
and then tragedy struck
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite
waitress was sweet and funny
d rather eat airline food seriously
cant say enough good things about this place
the ambiance was incredible
the waitress and manager are so friendly
would not recommend this place
overall was n t very impressed with
my gyro was basically lettuce only
terrible service
thoroughly disappointed
give it try you will be happy you did
by far the best we have ever had
reasonably priced also
everything was perfect the night we were in
the food is very good for your typical bar food
it was drive to get there
anyway do not think will go back there
oh this is such thing of beauty this restaurant
if you have n t gone here go now
greasy unhealthy meal
first time there and might just be the last
those burgers were amazing
and it was way to expensive
the bartender was also nice
everything was good and tasty
this place is two thumbs up way up
terrible management
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman
if there were zero stars would give it zero stars
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts
worst martini ever
had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh
wo n t try going back there even if it s empty
just spicy enough perfect actually
not even hello we will be right with you
the desserts were bit strange
nice ambiance
would recommend saving room for this
guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good
avoid this establishment
think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough
all of the tapas dishes were delicious
heart this place
my salad had bland on the baby greens and hearts of palm
after two felt disgusting
good time
generous portions and great taste
food was delicious
an hour seriously
consider this theft
eew this location needs complete overhaul
waited and waited and waited
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service
our server was super nice and checked on us many times
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not good way
swung in to give them try but was deeply disappointed
service was good and the company was better
the staff are also very friendly and efficient
boy was that sucker dry
over rated
if you look for authentic thai food go else where
their steaks are recommended
after pulled up my car waited for another minutes before being acknowledged
great food and great service in clean and friendly setting
all in all can assure you ll be back
hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives
the kids play area is nasty
great place fo take out or eat in
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan veggie options
omg felt like had never eaten thai food until this dish
it was extremely and pretty tasteless
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus
got home to see the driest damn wings ever
it ll be regular stop on my trips to phoenix
not good for the money
miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia
they also have the best cheese crisp in town
good value great food great service
could n t ask for more satisfying meal
the food is good
it was awesome
just wanted to leave
will not be eating there again
checked out this place couple years ago and was not impressed
sorry will not be getting food from here anytime soon

the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing
my friend did not like his bloody mary
they really want to make your experience good one
will not return
had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland
very disappointing
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning
pretty awesome place
ambience is perfect

level spicy was perfect where spice did n t over the soup
this is great place to eat
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good
the service was poor and thats being nice
food was good service was good prices were good

the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather
but the service was beyond bad
m so happy to be here

the block was amazing
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely stars
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless
great time family dinner on sunday night
what did bother me was the slow service
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste
these were so good we ordered them twice
my girlfriend s veal was very bad
unfortunately it was not good

bland and flavorless is good way of describing the barely tepid meat
the chains which m no fan of beat this place easily
the nachos are must have
we will not be coming back
great atmosphere friendly and fast service
once your food arrives it s meh
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh
this place is great
mediocre food
once you get inside you ll be impressed with the place
m super
and service was super friendly
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked
this place was such nice surprise
they were golden crispy and delicious
could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered
the service was terrible though
it was packed
love this place
can say that the desserts were yummy
the food was terrible
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree
it kept getting worse and worse so now m officially done
this place should honestly be blown up
but definitely would not eat here again
do not waste your money here
the cr pe was delicate and thin and moist
awful service
wo n t ever go here again
food quality has been horrible
the service here is fair at best
do yourself favor and stay away from this dish
very poor service
they were excellent

food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small
recently tried caballero s and have been back every week since
for bucks head really expect better food
the food came out at good pace

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were
this place deserves no stars
would not recommend this place
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit
probably would not go here again
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat
the price is reasonable and the service is great
went in for happy hour great list of wines
probably wo n t be coming back here
worst food service ve had in while
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant
talk about great customer service of course we will be back
love their fries and their beans
always pleasure dealing with him
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go
this is the worst sushi have ever eat besides costco s
my boyfriend and sat at the bar and had completely delightful experience
weird vibe from owners
there was hardly any meat
ve had better bagels from the grocery store
go to place for gyros
love the owner chef his one authentic japanese cool dude
found six inch long piece of wire in my salsa
the service was terrible food was mediocre
we definately enjoyed ourselves
had about two bites and refused to eat anymore
the service was extremely slow
after minutes wait got table
seriously killer hot chai latte
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love
their rotating beers on tap is also highlight of this place
pricing is bit of concern at mellow mushroom
worst thai ever
the pizza selections are good
had strawberry tea which was good
highly unprofessional and rude to loyal patron
overall great experience
spend your money elsewhere
the buffet at bellagio was far from what anticipated
and the drinks are weak people
my order was not correct
also feel like the chips are bought not made in house
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert
the chips and sals here is amazing
we wo n t be returning
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot
very very sad
m not impressed with the concept or the food
there is really nothing for me at hope your experience is better
got food poisoning here at the buffet
needless to say wo n t be going back anytime soon
this place is disgusting
every time eat here see caring teamwork to professional degree
the ri style calamari was joke
it was so bad had lost the heart to finish it
disappointing experience
over rated is all am saying
we wo n t be going back
this place lacked style
the sangria was about half of glass wine full and was ridiculous
do n t bother coming here
the meat was pretty dry had the sliced brisket and pulled pork
it was equally awful
probably not in hurry to go back
very slow at seating even with reservation
not good by any stretch of the imagination
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked
it was bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
was very disappointed
this place is horrible and way overpriced
it was n t busy at all and now we know why
con spotty service
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger
but then they came back cold
then our food came out disappointment ensued
the real disappointment was our waiter
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
it s not hard to make decent hamburger
but do n t like it
hell no will go back
the ambiance is n t much better
unfortunately it only set us up for with our entrees
the food was n t good
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked
what happened next was pretty off putting
overpriced for what you are getting
vomited in the bathroom mid lunch
food was below average
all in all ha long bay was bit of flop
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry
it really is impressive that the place has n t closed down
would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage
spend your money and time some place else
the presentation of the food was awful
ca n t tell you how disappointed was
think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
appetite instantly gone
overall was not impressed and would not go back
