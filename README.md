# Supervised Sentence Embeddings using Quantum Random Walks

This project demonstrates how Quantum Random Walks (QW) can be used to obtain supervised sentence embeddings for a 
Sentiment Classification task. QWs are used to obtain a distribution over the words in a sentence, which are used 
as weights to combine the embeddings of the constituent words to form the sentence embeddings.
